The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
**1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras.
**2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
**3rd Round:** The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in  line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell (Magic item's saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled.
It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.
The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration.
During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage.
In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.
Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage.
Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.

A fire trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth).
When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center.
When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center.
The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.
A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap.
An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.
Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast.
Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.
Note:Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a fire trap and Disable Device to thwart it.

A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture and low walls.
It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.
The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns.
It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size.
The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame.

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.
Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell.
(Magic item's saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated.
It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.
The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration.
During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage.
In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.
Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage roll from a heat metal spell indicates 2 points of fire damage and the subject is hit by a ray of frost in the same round and takes 3 points of cold damage, it winds up taking no fire damage and only 1 point of cold damage.
If cast underwater, heat metal deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.

Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

(A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).
Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of **animate dead**.  (The <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/desecrate--2604/">deserate</a> spell doubles this limit; see page 218).
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level.

If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
**Skeletons:** A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons.
**Zombies:** A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie. The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies}}

If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud.
Magical stone is not affected by the spell.
The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet.
A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC.
Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it.
Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.
If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet.
For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud.
Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet.
The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.
However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance&#8212;but not necessarily its form.
Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.
The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement,
invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth.
Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects.
(See the individual spell descriptions for details).
An area can receive only one unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time.
Unhallow counters but does not dispel hallow.
Material Component:Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be tied to the unhallowed area}}

A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.
Holly Berry Bombs: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs.
The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet).
If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet.

The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more.
The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack.
A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.
The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below).
An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.
Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.
Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on hit points for walls and the like).
Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground.
Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.
Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand.
At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
Pinned beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.
If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead}}

When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature.
You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.
Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.
