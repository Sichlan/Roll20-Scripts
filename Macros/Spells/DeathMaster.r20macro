The writing can be visible or invisible.
An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance (even stone or metal) without harm to the material upon which it is placed.
If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.
See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark.
A read magic spell reveals the words, if any.
The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.
If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.
Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting Drawmij's instant summons on the same object (see that spell description for details)}}

**1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras.
**2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
**3rd Round:** The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in  line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans).
Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created.
The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.
A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.
A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour.
The effects are minor and have severe limitations.
A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material.
It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round.
It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters.
Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial.
The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.
Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.
Characters typically use prestidigitation spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives.
Common tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs}}

**3rd Round:** The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. 
For example, as indicated on the table, an evil outsider with 12 HD has an overwhelming aura of evil. A good cleric who casts this spell and directs it at the location of such a creature for longer than 1  round loses the spell and is stunned for 1 round if his character level is 6th or lower.

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area.
A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details). 
The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not). 
The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item&#8212;a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.
A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin. Material Component: A bit of pork rind or butter}}

You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.  You retain your own ability scores.  Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same.
You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.  Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.  You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind.  The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place.  They remain animated until they are destroyed.
(A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).
Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of **animate dead**.  (The <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/desecrate--2604/">deserate</a> spell doubles this limit; see page 218).
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled.  (You choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
**Skeletons:** A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons.
**Zombies:** A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie. The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies}}

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.
Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell (Magic item's saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled.
It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.
The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration.
During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage.
In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.
Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage.
Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.
Chill metal counters and dispels heat metal}}

You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do.
(Retries are not allowed).
An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing (see charm person).
A nonintelligent undead creature (such as a skeleton or zombie) gets no saving throw against this spell.
When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;come here&quot;, &quot;go there&quot;, &quot;fight&quot;, &quot;stand still&quot;, and so on.
Nonintelligent undead won't resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.
Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell.
Your commands are not telepathic.
The undead creature must be able to hear you.

Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light spells of lower level (such as light or dancing lights).
Higher level light spells (such as daylight) are not affected by darkness.

Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped.
You affect a 10-footsquare area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM's option).
Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected.
Earth or stone creatures are not affected.
A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells.
A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge.
Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface.
Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.
For example, a party of adventurers trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall.
While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected.
Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.
A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure (such as a wall or a tower) by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle.
However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed}}

For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand.
The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack.
The hand always strikes from your direction.
The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can.

These strands trap those caught in them.
The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher.
These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points&#8212;floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like&#8212;or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears.
Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers.
Attacking a creature in a web won't cause you to become entangled.
Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save.
If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below).
If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check.
Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly.
Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check.
The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover.
If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover (see Cover, page 150).
The strands of a web spell are flammable.
A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs.
Any fire&#8212;a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth&#8212;can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round.
All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight.
An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (page 219).
If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each.
(Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect).
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.
In some cases, arcane sight may give a deceptively low reading&#8212;for example, when you use it on a spellcaster who has used up most of his or her daily spell allotment.

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form.
(This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials).
The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form.

A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet (maneuverability perfect).
It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists.
The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid.
It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form.
Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot (such as those that supply armor or natural armor bonuses).

The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions.
When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone.
If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded.
You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone.
Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you.
Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage.
The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save.
Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered.
If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.
The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: Stone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage.
Stone shape deals you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you.
Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled.
Finally, passwall expels you without damage}}

The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount.
A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound.
It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle.
It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.
The mount has an AC of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level.
If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears.
A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet.
It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level.
A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.
Thus, a mount created by a 12th-level caster has the 8th, 10th, and 12th caster level abilities.
8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.
10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).
12th Level: The mount can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.
14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).
<strong>Special: When casting **phantom steed** as a Spider Domain spell, the steed has a vermin shape.</strong}}

Each negative level gives a creature a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).
Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest available level.
Negative levels stack.
Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours).
Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the victim's levels, but the negative levels from enervation don't last long enough to do so.

Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles.
Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19.
Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8.
The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.
Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage.
The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.
Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles.
Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.

The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability.
Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe.
Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items.
However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe.
Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast.
The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area dispel magic.
You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.
Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.
For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a mirror image created by a caster outside the globe.
If that caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to reappear when the caster exited the globe.
Likewise, a caster standing in the area of a light spell would still receive sufficient illumination for vision, even though that part of the light spell's area that lies within the globe would not be luminous.
If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures.
Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created.
Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed.
A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.
Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).
Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears.
The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level.
It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet).
The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored.
A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like.
Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.
Creatures can hit the wall automatically.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains.
Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).
Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level.
Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius.
The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach}}

It can write in the languages it understands, but only the form is capable of writing in some manner (such as drawing in the dirt with a paw).</li></ul>With those exceptions, the target's normal game statistics are replaced by those of the new form. The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features.
All items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form.
If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.
If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save. If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form,  and its Hit Dice and hit points change to match an average creature of its new form. These abilities and  statistics return to normal if the effect is later ended.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the spell's effect)}}

These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save).
A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).
A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage).
Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.
Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.
Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.
Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying hives of giant ants, for example.
It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater}}

For example, at 16th level you could decide to create a ghoul or a ghast instead of a mummy. Doing this may be a good idea, because created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159).
This spell must be cast at night.
Material Component: A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The spell must be cast on a dead body.

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.
If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).
Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81).
Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.
You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it}}

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar.
You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body.
The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.
To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it.
When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.
While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence).
You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures.
You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures.
In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.
(Undead creatures are powered by negative energy.
Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls).
For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within the range, all powered by positive energy.
You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.
Attempting to possess a body is a fullround action.
It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward.
You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save.
Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.
If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar.
You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.
The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities.
For example, a fish's body breathes water and a troll's body regenerates.
A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities.
The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.
As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body.
The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.
If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead).
If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die.
Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.
If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed).
If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range).
Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or at the host's location}}

If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting.
If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell (see page 69) or the spell ends.
If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.
You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance.
(You always fail any saving throw, for example).
Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or dream are immune to this spell}}

This has three major effects.
First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle against good effect.
Second, all turning checks made to turn undead take a -4 penalty, and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +4 profane bonus.
Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.
(This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell).
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site.
The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect.
You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment.
For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of like alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposite alignment or an enemy faith.
At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement,
invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth.
Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects.
(See the individual spell descriptions for details).
An area can receive only one unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time.
Unhallow counters but does not dispel hallow.

It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.
A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell's area by half.
Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow.
The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.
You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane.
Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end.
It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.
Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10&#215;100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint.
If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10&#215;1,000 feet in the same direction.
If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).
Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.
The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.
They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you).
Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful}}

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.
An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. 
Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result). 
A normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field.
Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more about artifacts).
Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field}}

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect.

If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.
To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body.
The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (for example, by the gentle repose spell).
Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.
When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead.
The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original.
In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character).
If this Constitution adjustment would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails.
If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which the original died.

When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150.
The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.
Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first.
Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.
A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.
Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).
To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.
Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.
As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.
Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).
Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.
In this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.
Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.
You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.
Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.
These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.
Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.
For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.
Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.
If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.
Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.
Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.
Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.
Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.
You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.
Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.
An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.
Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.
Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.

The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform.
If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed.
Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.
Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject.
This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect.
If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2.
If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.
Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap.
To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled.
A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object.
As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save}}

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.
These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times.
If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation.
The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.
Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will.
To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord.
If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically.
Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).
When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely.
Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them.
The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you)}}

You are never surprised or flat-footed.
In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself&#8212;duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on&#8212;and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.
This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature.
You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.
Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.
The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.
