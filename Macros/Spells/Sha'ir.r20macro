An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance (even stone or metal) without harm to the material upon which it is placed.
If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.
See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark.
A read magic spell reveals the words, if any.
The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.
If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.

(Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour.

A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material.
It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round.
It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters.
Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial.
The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.
Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.
Characters typically use prestidigitation spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives.
Common tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs}}

Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it.
Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.
Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15.
(A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check).
If you fail to erase explosive runes, a glyph of warding, or a sepia snake sigil, you accidentally activate that writing instead}}

Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a
fall froma few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect.
However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall.
Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.
You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn.
This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance.
If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.
(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on falling objects).
Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects.
It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature}}

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area.
A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details). 
The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not). 
The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item&#8212;a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.
A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin. Material Component: A bit of pork rind or butter}}

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.
First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.
Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, a summon monster I is a lawful and evil spell when cast to summon a fiendish dire rat.

You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.  Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.  You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind.  The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6&#215;10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.
Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6&#215;10 feet.
Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6&#215;5 feet.
Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect.
A gust of wind can't move a creature beyond the limit of its range.
Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a gust of wind.
The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames.
It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.
In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do.
It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell}}

It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests.
It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut).
If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes.
In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.
Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.
The effect is limited by the area.
A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot
door).
Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.
Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two knock spells}}

You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).
A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5.
A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1}}

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes.
The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.
It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak.
Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell.
Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: &quot;Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within a distance of one foot&quot;.
Triggers react to what appears to be the case.
Disguises and illusions can fool them.
Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does.
Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers.
Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says &quot;Boo&quot;).
Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible.
For example, &quot;Speak when any creature touches the statue&quot;
is an acceptable command if the creature is visible.
A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.
The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.
Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.
Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell}}

You can move into and through a mirror image.
When you and the mirror image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image.
The figments may also move through each other.
The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets.
Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment.

Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights.
This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).
These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected.
Spell resistance can prevent blindness.
Smoke Cloud: A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud.
The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level.
All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud.
All within the cloud take -4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates).
These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud.
Spell resistance does not apply.
Material Component: The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished.
A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished.
Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level}}

The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. 
Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice.
Note: Resist energy overlaps (and does not stack with) protection from energy.
If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted}}

The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (&quot;planes&quot;).
Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes.
The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size).
Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope &quot;disappear&quot;.
In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space.
The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds.
A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.
Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it.
Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope.
The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it.
Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.
The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time.
The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.
Note: It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one.

All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell.
Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.
Alternatively, you can target shatter against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level.

(The hit points can be healed as normal).
For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand.

The hand always strikes from your direction.
The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can.
After it delivers a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers.
The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons.

These strands trap those caught in them.
The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher.
These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points&#8212;floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like&#8212;or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears.
Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers.
Attacking a creature in a web won't cause you to become entangled.
Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save.
If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below).
If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check.
Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly.
Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check.
The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover.
If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover (see Cover, page 150).
The strands of a web spell are flammable.
A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs.
Any fire&#8212;a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth&#8212;can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round.
All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location.
(It can't pass through walls, for instance).
A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location.
It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound.
Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it.
The wind then dissipates.
You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air.
You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.
When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered.
As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects}}

The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight.
An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (page 219).
If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each.
(Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect).
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.
In some cases, arcane sight may give a deceptively low reading&#8212;for example, when you use it on a spellcaster who has used up most of his or her daily spell allotment.
Arcane sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell}}

You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.
Blinking has several effects, as follows.
Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible.
If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).
If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%.
(For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance).
Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.
Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures.
Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.
While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.
You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects.
For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material.
If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.
You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material).
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.
You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost.
An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down.
As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial.
Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally.
Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.
An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack.
Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material}}

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the **fireball** at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must &quot;hit&quot; the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
The **fireball** sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

This extra speed has several effects.
When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round).
A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.
Multiple haste effects don't stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.

Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as illusory script.
Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw.
A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation.
Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast.
The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.
Typical suggestions include &quot;Close the book and leave&quot;, &quot;Forget the existence of the book&quot;, and so forth.
If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear.
The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.
The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.

As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it.
However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
The temperature inside the hut is 70Â° F if the exterior temperature is between 0Â° and 100Â° F.
An exterior temperature below 0Â° or above 100Â° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus, if it's -20Â° outside, inside the hut it's 50Â°).
The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms.
The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere.
You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired.
Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within.
Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through
the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it.
A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward.
When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle.
The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries.
If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.
A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap.
If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends.
The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can.
If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day.
If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.
A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.
You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.
If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does.
The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can.
The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure.
Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check.
The DM makes this check secretly.
If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective.
You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.
This task also takes 10 full minutes.
If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell.
The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level.
A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.
If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5.
The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&#8212;even a straw laid across it.
However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.
This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa}}

The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount.
A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound.
It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle.
It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.
The mount has an AC of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level.
If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears.
A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet.
It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level.
A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.
Thus, a mount created by a 12th-level caster has the 8th, 10th, and 12th caster level abilities.
8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.
10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).
12th Level: The mount can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.
14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).

The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long.
When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.
Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it.
The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike.
If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise.
If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed.
While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells.
It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings.
It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury.
However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.
The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical.
A dispel magic can remove the sigil.
An erase spell destroys the entire page of text.
Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells
that hide or garble text, such as secret page.

(A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object). Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected). Gases,  most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it  is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).
While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points. A 5th-level caster can create a wall up to 50 feet long and up to 25 feet high, sufficient to form a cylinder of wind 15 feet in diameter.

(A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).
Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of **animate dead**.  (The <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/desecrate--2604/">deserate</a> spell doubles this limit; see page 218).
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled.  (You choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
**Skeletons:** A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons.
**Zombies:** A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie. The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies}}

The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).
Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15).
This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks).
If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.
Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet).
The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)&#8212;blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed.
The special powers of each version are as follows.
Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch.
You take only half damage from cold-based attacks.
If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch.
You take only half damage from fire-based attacks.
If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

A fire trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth).
When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center.
When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center.
The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.
A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap.
An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.
Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast.
Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.
Note:Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a fire trap and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid's fire trap or DC 29 for the arcane version).

The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you.
While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.
The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.
If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions (such as &quot;Wait here&quot; or &quot;Defend this area against attack&quot;), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level.
A clever recipient can subvert some instructions: For example, if you order the recipient to protect you from all harm, it might place you in a nice, safe dungeon for the duration of the spell.
If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores.
Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of &#8211; 8.
No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect.
The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas.
A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish.

The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability.
Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe.
Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items.
However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe.
Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast.
The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area dispel magic.
You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.
Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.
For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a mirror image created by a caster outside the globe.
If that caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to reappear when the caster exited the globe.
Likewise, a caster standing in the area of a light spell would still receive sufficient illumination for vision, even though that part of the light spell's area that lies within the globe would not be luminous.
If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.

Rainbow pattern fascinates a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures.
Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.
Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first.
An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern.
With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin).
All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect.
Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it.
If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), each fascinated creature gets a second save.
If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscuring mist spell, for instance), creatures who can't see them are no longer affected.
The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.
Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.
Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.
Spells that deal damage, such as Melf's acid arrow, have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save.
Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack.
If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur.
Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.
In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not.
Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mist, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.
Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.
A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy).
It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses.
Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work.
(Roll for each use and each affected character separately).
Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11).
A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.
Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell}}

The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like).
A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
A creature can't take a 5-foot step while in solid fog.
However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.
Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures.
Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created.
Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed.
A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.
Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).
Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears.
The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level.
It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet).
The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored.
A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like.
Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.
Creatures can hit the wall automatically.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains.
Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).
Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level.
Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius.
The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach}}

The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2-2 in the **Dungeon Master's Guide**.  The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change.
The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.
<strong>Special: When casting **animal growth** as a Scalykind Domain spell, only ophidian and reptilian creatures are affected.</strong>
If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.  If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it&#8212;the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.
The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting}}

The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features.
All items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form.
If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.
If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save. If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form,  and its Hit Dice and hit points change to match an average creature of its new form.

Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the spell's effect)}}

Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone.
For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.
For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it.
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.
For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user.
Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item&#8212;

These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save).
A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).
A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage).
Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.
Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.
Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.
Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying hives of giant ants, for example.

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.
If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).
Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81).
Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.
You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it}}

The communication is one-way.

The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).
If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails.
Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters.
If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum.
If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold.
If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal).
The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp.
Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy.
(The replica costs 50 gp).
You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time&#8212;even a wish spell does not allow more.
The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica.
The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane.
You need the replica to recall the chest.
After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost.
If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.
Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive}}

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar.
You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body.
The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.
To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it.
When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.
While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence).
You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures.
You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures.
In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.
(Undead creatures are powered by negative energy.
Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls).
For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within the range, all powered by positive energy.
You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.
Attempting to possess a body is a fullround action.
It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward.
You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save.
Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.
If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar.
You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.
The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities.
For example, a fish's body breathes water and a troll's body regenerates.
A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities.
The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.
As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body.
The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.
If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead).
If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die.
Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.
If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed).
If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range).
Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or at the host's location}}

Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter.

The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures.
It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.
If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round.
The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature.
The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn.
Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction.
The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level.
If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward.
The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated.
If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.
The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw.
If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell.
If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).
The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier).
It can try each method once per day.
If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.
A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel.
You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil, page 246) to make the trap more secure.
If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare.
You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward.
You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check.
The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward.
If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service.
New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours.
This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell.
Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.
If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.
Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.
The creature might later seek revenge.
If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as &quot;Wait here&quot; or &quot;Defend this area against attack&quot;), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.
Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
For example, lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental}}


Prying Eyes(Player's Handbook v.3.5): - Sha'ir(5)

These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.
While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.
When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well.
A sample command: &quot;Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures&quot;. The phrase &quot;Surround me&quot; directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A &quot;peasant&quot; that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger an eye's return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring.
Another sample command: &quot;Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return&quot;. The phrase &quot;Spread out&quot; directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him.
Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions.
In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.
If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.
The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. **Dispel magic** can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself}}

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.
**Sustained Force:** A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.
This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.
An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require  Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM.
**Combat Maneuver:** Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you  cease concentration.
**Violent Thrust:** Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object  or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).
You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).
Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves  (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points)}}

Interplanar travel is not possible.
You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.
You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels.
A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.
All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you.
Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.
You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination.
You can't simply teleport to the warlord's tent if you don't know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what's in it.
The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works.
Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.
To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table.
Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
Familiarity: &quot;Very familiar&quot; is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.
&quot;Studied carefully&quot; is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour.
&quot;Seen casually&quot; is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar.
&quot;Viewed once&quot; is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.
&quot;False destination&quot; is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on a enemy's sanctum but instead viewed a false vision, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground).
When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.
On Target: You appear where you want to be.
Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
Distance off target is 1d10&#215;1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled.
For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target.
That's 18 miles, in this case.
The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth.
If you were teleporting to a coastal city and would up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.
A wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory.
Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range.
If the DM determines no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.
Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten &quot;scrambled&quot;.
You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up.
For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.
Each time &quot;Mishap&quot; comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll}}

If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud.
Magical stone is not affected by the spell.
The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet.
A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC.
Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it.
Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.
If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet.
For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud.
Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet.
The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.
However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance&#8212;but not necessarily its form.
Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.
The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier.
It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings).
Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force.
The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level.
The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed.
If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.
Wall of force can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.
A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell's area by half.
Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.
An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. 
Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result). 
A normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field.
Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more about artifacts).
Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field}}

Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates.
If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

The type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.
<table><tr><th>Caster Level </th><th>Undead Created </th></tr><tr><td> 11th or lower </td><td> Ghoul </td></tr><tr><td> 12th-14th </td><td> Ghast </td></tr><tr><td> 15th-17th </td><td> Mummy </td></tr><tr><td> 18th or higher </td><td> Mohrg</td></tr></table>You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. For example, at 16th level you could decide to create a ghoul or a ghast instead of a mummy. Doing this may be a good idea, because created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159).
This spell must be cast at night.
Material Component: A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The spell must be cast on a dead body. You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless shells}}

The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as Bigby's forceful hand or a wall of force, but not magical effects such as a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic field.
A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage.
If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.
Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.

A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a remove disease or heal spell, but a remove curse is effective.
**Panicked:** The subject becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.
**Comatose:** The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a sleep effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire.
You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell.
The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.
Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).
Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
Saving Throw: None.
Spell Resistance: No.
Arcane Locks: All doors in the warded area are arcane locked.
Saving Throw: None.
Spell Resistance: No.
Webs:Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom.
These strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts.
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for web.
Spell Resistance: No.
Confusion:Where there are choices in direction&#8212;such as a corridor intersection or side passage&#8212;a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose.
This is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect.
Saving Throw: None.

Lost Doors:One door per caster level is covered by a silent image to appear as if it were a plain wall.
Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with).
Spell Resistance: No.

1. Dancing lights in four corridors.
You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards and wards spell lasts.
Saving Throw: None.
Spell Resistance: No.
2. A magic mouth in two places.
Saving Throw: None.
Spell Resistance: No.
3. A stinking cloud in two places.
The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts.

Spell Resistance: No.
4. A gust of wind in one corridor or room.

5. A suggestion in one place.
You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.
Saving Throw: Will negates.
Spell Resistance: Yes.
The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school.
A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4&#215;10 minutes.
If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth.
When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind.
These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known.
If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information.
As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are &quot;legendary&quot;, as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.
Examples of legend lore results include the following.
A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: &quot;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones.
Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'
on the lips&quot;.
A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: &quot;Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life.
He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain&quot;.
(The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain).
A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: &quot;The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods.
Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day&quot;.
(These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore)}}

An elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8).
If the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10-foot square) per caster level (maximum 1,500 square feet).
This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level.
Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice.
Attempting to break free is a full-round action.
A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.
You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish.
Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge (see page 176).
You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect).
Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action}}

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow.
The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.
You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane.
Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end.
It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.
Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10&#215;100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint.
If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10&#215;1,000 feet in the same direction.
If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).
Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.
The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.
They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you).
Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful}}

substance.
Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available.

This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it.
The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed.
Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly.
A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over.
Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves.
Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage.
The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.
Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.
Material Component: A small piece of sheet iron plus gold dust worth 50 gp (1 pound of gold dust)}}

It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished. You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance (if any), the saving throw DC increases by 2. For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell. The three items would give you a +3 bonus on your check to overcome the demon's spell resistance and add 6 to the spell's save DC.
At the DM's option, certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4)}}

For the duration of the spell, you are in a place called the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the normal, physical, Material Plane.
When the spell expires, you return to material existence.
An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed.
As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral.
Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally.
Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.
An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk's gaze attack).
Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material.

Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails.
Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
Like a wall of force spell, a forcecage resists dispel magic, but it is vulnerable to a disintegrate spell, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation.
Barred Cage: This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a wall of force spell) for bars.
The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them.
Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined.
You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps.
Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover.
All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.
Windowless Cell: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out.

The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell.
The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn.
Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Int bonus or your Cha bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus.
As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures.
It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19-20 and a critical multiplier of x2.
The sword always strikes from your direction.
It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one.
If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers.
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target.
If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target.
The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical
attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it.
The sword's AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time Mordenkainen's sword strikes it.
If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled.

From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The DM secretly rolls the exact number. When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left. 
When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected. 
For example, if you had three levels of spell turning left and were targeted by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/magic-missile--2631/">**magic missile**</a> spell heightened to 4th level, you  would turn three-fourths of the spell back at the caster.

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.
You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell.
For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1.
For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell.
Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant.
Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts.
All binding spells are dismissible.
Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur.
These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.
The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify.
For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.
Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.
If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap.
If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw.
If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.
The binding spell has six versions.
Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.
Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you.
The duration is one year per caster level.
The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.
Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level.
The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age.
This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist.
Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.
Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level.
Reduce the save DC by 2.
Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means.
The effect is permanent.
Reduce the save DC by 3.
Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face.
It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose.
The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities.
The binding is permanent.
The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age.
Reduce the save DC by 4.
Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object.
The binding is permanent.
The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age.
Reduce the save DC by 4.
You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mordenkainen's disjunction affects it normally.
A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect}}

If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.
To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body.
The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (for example, by the gentle repose spell).
Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.
When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead.
The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original.
In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character).
If this Constitution adjustment would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails.
If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which the original died.
The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment.

To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once}}

You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell.
If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round.
If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the spell's duration expires, or you begin concentrating again.
If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration.
The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.
You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.

The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state.
The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines.
Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form.
If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.
Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature.
For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and then grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death.
If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed.
Perhaps you could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide.
In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM must adjudicate many of these situations.
A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell.
Magic items aren't affected by this spell.
This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine.
It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.
This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of baleful polymorph, polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute metal to wood, or transmute rock to mud.

The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall.
The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.
Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.
The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a Mordenkainen's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.
Prismatic wall can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area.
The illusion created must be stated in general terms.
Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game.
You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area.
You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible.
Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.
Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed.
Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created.
A band of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance.
Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen.
Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another.
Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion}}

When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150.
The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.
Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first.
Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.
A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.
Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).
To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.
Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.
As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.
Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).
Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.
In this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.
Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.
You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.
Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.
These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.
Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.
For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.
Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.
If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.
Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.
Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.
Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.
Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.
You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.
Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.
An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.
Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.
Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death}}

The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform.
If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed.
Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.
Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject.
This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect.
If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2.
If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.
Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap.
To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled.
A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object.
As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save}}

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.
These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times.
If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation.
The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.
Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will.
To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord.
If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically.
Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).
When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely.
Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them.
The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you)}}

Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell.
Thus, if you are the subject of the spell, you would be warned in advance if a rogue were about to attempt a sneak attack on you, or if a creature were about to leap out from a hiding place, or if an attacker were specifically targeting you with a spell or ranged weapon.
You are never surprised or flat-footed.
In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself&#8212;duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on&#8212;and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.
This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature.
You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.
Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.
The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the **gate**. The **gate** itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
A **gate** has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the **gate** from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
**Planar Travel:** As a mode of planar travel, a **gate** spell functions much like a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/plane-shift--2423/">**plane shift**</a> spell, except that the **gate** opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a **gate** from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you&#8212;anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A **gate** cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
You could position a **gate** in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.
You may hold the **gate** open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.
**Calling Creatures:** The second effect of the **gate** spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the **gate** to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the **gate**, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a **gate** that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).
If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual&#8212;for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin&#8212;you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.
A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.
If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in &quot;livestock&quot; rather than in coin, which could involve complications). Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.
Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.
**Note:** When you use a calling spell such as **gate** to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, **gate** is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon}}

The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.
If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor.
Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and receives no saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below).
If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space.
You may aim more than one meteor at the same target.
Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each.

You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field.

Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items.

The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action.
For example, you are in combat and assume the form of a will-o'-wisp.
When this form is no longer useful, you change into a stone golem and walk away.
When pursued, you change into a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off.
From there, you can become a dragon, an orc, or just about anything else you are familiar with.
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check}}

Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it.
The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.
The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice.
If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way, such as by placing it on a raised platform.
Teleportation circle can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
Note:Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of teleportation circle.
Material Component: Amber dust to cover the area of the circle (cost 1,000 gp)}}

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even **wish**, however, has its limits.
A **wish** can produce any one of the following effects.
<ul><li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li><li>Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li><li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li><li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li><li>Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as **geas/quest** or **insanity**.</li><li>Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li><li>Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.</li><li>Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five **wish** spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li><li>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single **wish** can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same **wish**. A **wish** can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</li><li>Revive the dead. A **wish** can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A **wish** can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two **wish**, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A **wish** cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.</li><li>Transport travelers. A **wish** can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li><li>Undo misfortune. A **wish** can undo a single recent event. The **wish** forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a **wish** could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li></ul>You may try to use a **wish** to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a **wish** gives the DM the opportunity to fulfil your request without fulfilling it completely. (The **wish** may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment). For example, wishing for a **staff of the** magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff's current owner. Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisoned in a hidden extradimensional space (as by an imprisonment spell), where you could &quot;live&quot; indefinitely.
Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells)}}
