The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
**1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras.
**2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
**3rd Round:** The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in  line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as bless, good hope, and rage, as well as negating a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability.
It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets.
While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect.
When the calm emotions spell ends, the original spell or
effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime}}

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.
Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell (Magic item's saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled.
It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.
The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration.
During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage.
In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.
Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage.
Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.

The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result.

In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.
Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage roll from a heat metal spell indicates 2 points of fire damage and the subject is hit by a ray of frost in the same round and takes 3 points of cold damage, it winds up taking no fire damage and only 1 point of cold damage.

The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. 
Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice.
Note: Resist energy overlaps (and does not stack with) protection from energy.
If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted}}

The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (&quot;planes&quot;).
Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes.
The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size).
Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope &quot;disappear&quot;.
In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space.
The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds.
A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.
Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it.
Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope.
The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it.
Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.
The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time.
The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.
Note: It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.
Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.
However, a suggestion that a pool of acid is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter.
Urging a red dragon to stop attacking your party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is a likewise reasonable use of the spell's power.
The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above.
If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.
For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

A warped melee weapon causes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.
You may warp one Small or smaller object (such as a wagon wheel or a human's crossbow) or its equivalent per caster level.

Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means.
Make whole, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.
You can combine multiple consecutive warp wood spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell.

However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
The temperature inside the hut is 70Â° F if the exterior temperature is between 0Â° and 100Â° F.
An exterior temperature below 0Â° or above 100Â° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus, if it's -20Â° outside, inside the hut it's 50Â°).
The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms.
The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere.
You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired.
Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within.
Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through
the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.
If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).
Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81).
Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.
You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it}}

The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled.

Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand.

If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth.
When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind.
These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known.
If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information.
As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are &quot;legendary&quot;, as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.
Examples of legend lore results include the following.
A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: &quot;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones.
Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'
on the lips&quot;.
A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: &quot;Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life.
He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain&quot;.
(The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain).
A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: &quot;The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods.
Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day&quot;.

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds.
If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you.
However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden.
Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf.
Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.
Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.
Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.
Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid.
If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession.
If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.
Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours.
The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process.
Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment.
No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment.
This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.
Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.
Note:Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (for NPCs).
This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively}}

Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area.<ul><li>A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.</li><li>An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center.</li><li>A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion.</li><li>A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.</li></ul>
Wind Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level.
(The categories of wind strength are briefly described below, with more detail to be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area.
Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.
A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.
A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.
Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.
A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees}}

You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment.

If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails.
Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters.
If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum.
If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold.
If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal).
The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp.
Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy.
(The replica costs 50 gp).
You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time&#8212;even a wish spell does not allow more.
The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica.
The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane.
You need the replica to recall the chest.
After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost.
If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.

If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud.
Magical stone is not affected by the spell.
The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet.
A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC.
Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it.
Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.
If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet.
For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud.
Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet.
The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.
However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance&#8212;but not necessarily its form.
Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.
The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

This has three major effects.
First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle against good effect.
Second, all turning checks made to turn undead take a -4 penalty, and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +4 profane bonus.
Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.
(This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell).
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site.
The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect.
You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment.
For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of like alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposite alignment or an enemy faith.
At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement,
invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth.
Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects.
(See the individual spell descriptions for details).
An area can receive only one unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time.

It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.
A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell's area by half.
Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards and wards spell lasts.
Saving Throw: None.
Spell Resistance: No.
2. A magic mouth in two places.
Saving Throw: None.
Spell Resistance: No.
3. A stinking cloud in two places.
The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts.
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for stinking cloud.
Spell Resistance: No.
4. A gust of wind in one corridor or room.
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates.
Spell Resistance: Yes.
5. A suggestion in one place.
You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.
Saving Throw: Will negates.
Spell Resistance: Yes.
The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school.
A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved.
The area to be affected determines the casting time.
For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes.
The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground.
Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved.
Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.
The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures.
Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.
This spell has no effect on earth creatures.
Material Component: A mixture of soils (clay, loam, and sand) in a small bag, and an iron blade}}

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it.
The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed.
Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly.
A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over.
Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves.
Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage.
The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.
Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability.
If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability.
Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent.
If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form.
Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form).
As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes.

The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more.
The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack.
A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.
The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below).
An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.
Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.
Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on hit points for walls and the like).
Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground.
Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.
Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand.
At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
Pinned beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.
If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead}}

You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.
Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.

The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state.
The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines.
Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form.
If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.
Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature.
For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and then grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death.
If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed.
Perhaps you could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide.
In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM must adjudicate many of these situations.
A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell.
Magic items aren't affected by this spell.
This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine.
It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.
This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of baleful polymorph, polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute metal to wood, or transmute rock to mud.

If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends.

This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature.
You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.
Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.
