The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
**1st Round:** Presence or absence of evil.
**2nd Round:** Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.
**3rd Round:** The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. 
**Aura Power:** An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. 
For example, as indicated on the table, an evil outsider with 12 HD has an overwhelming aura of evil. A good cleric who casts this spell and directs it at the location of such a creature for longer than 1  round loses the spell and is stunned for 1 round if his character level is 6th or lower.

If **detect evil** is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.
First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.
Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.
**Arcane Material Component:** A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded}}

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it.
A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward.
When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle.
The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries.
If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.
A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap.
If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends.
The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can.
If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day.
If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.
A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.
You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.
If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does.
The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can.
The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure.
Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check.
The DM makes this check secretly.
If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective.
You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.
This task also takes 10 full minutes.
If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell.
The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level.
A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.
If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5.
The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&#8212;even a straw laid across it.
However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.
This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa}}

The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.
If the corpse has been subject to **speak with dead** within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.
This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.
This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature}}

The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.
For example, suppose the question is &quot;Will we do well if we venture into the ruined temple of Erythnul?&quot; The DM knows that a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a **+1 shield** lurks near the entrance but estimates that your party could beat the troll after a hard fight. Therefore the divination response might be: &quot;Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.&quot; In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. (For example, the troll could move away and take the treasure with it.)
The base chance for a correct **divination** is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.
As with <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/augury--2478/">**augury**</a>, multiple **divinations** about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first **divination** spell and yield the same answer each time.

The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. Thus, if a 10th-level character has been struck by a wight and drained to 9th level, restoration brings the character up to exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him to 10th level (45,000 XP), gaining him an additional Hit Die and level functions accordingly.
Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.
Restoration does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

"Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient.

(This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell).
Third, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature.
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the hallowed site.
The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect.
You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment.
For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of your alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposed alignment or an enemy faith.

You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level.
In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return (see Bringing Back the Dead, page 171).
If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal.
The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature.
If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be raised).
This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.
A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level.
A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.
A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice.
Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1.
Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone.
While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole.
Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life.
None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.
A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell.
Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised.
The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age}}
