You can protect yourself only against a natural occurrence or a nonmagical condition, not against a spell or the direct attack of a creature (such as the breath of a dragon or the swords of a group of bandits).
At the time of casting, you must specify the condition against which you wish to protect yourself.
Should you be subjected to that condition during the duration of the spell, you feel no discomfort and take no damage from the condition, though the spell does not protect any items carried on your person.
If you are still subject to the condition at the end of the spell's duration, you suffer its full normal effects.
Material Component: An ointment of peach syrup and cinnabar}}
