This transmutation imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with the order of law, turning it into axiomatic water. Axiomatic water damages chaotic outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders. A flask of axiomatic water can be thrown as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, the bearer must open the flask and pout the axiomatic water out onto the target. Thus, a character can douse an incorporeal creature with axiomatic water only if he is adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
A direct hit by a flask of axiomatic water deals 2d4 points of damage to a chaotic outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash}}

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect.

Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.
**Arcane Material Component:** A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded}}

First, the area is forbidden to the creature.
It must make a successful Will save to enter it by any means (movement, teleportation spells, and so on).
If it fails its Will save and was endeavoring to use a teleportation spell to enter the area, it is shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 10 feet of the protected area.
If no free space is available within 10 feet, the spell simply fails.
The creature can try to enter the area only once during its turn, but can continue to try on subsequent rounds.
Even if the named creature gets inside the barrier, the other aspects of the spell function normally.
Second, all creatures within the area gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from the named creature, and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws required by the named creature's spell effects and special attacks.
Third, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess or exercise mental control over those within the spell's area by the named creature, including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant ongoing control over the subject.
Bane of the archrival suppresses these effects for the duration of the spell or as long as the subject remains within the spell's area.

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

While druids and rangers are the classes most often known to cast this ancient spell, its magic is nearly universal and can be mastered by all spellcasting classes.
When you cast this spell, you trace the cerulean sign in the air with a hand, leaving a glowing blue rune in the air for a
brief moment before it flashes and fills the area of effect with a pulse of cerulean light.
Any aberration within the area must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the following ill effects.
Closer aberrations are affected first.
Each effect lasts for 1 round.
None: The aberration suffers no ill effect, even if it fails the
saving throw.
Sickened: The aberration takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round.
Nauseated: The aberration cannot attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything but take a single move action for 1 round.
Dazed: The aberration can take no actions, but has no penalty to its Armor Class, for 1 round.
Stunned: The aberration drops everything held, can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round.
Once a creature recovers from an effect, it moves up one level on the table.
Thus, a creature that is stunned by this spell is dazed the round after that, nauseated the round after that, sickened the round after that, and then recovers fully the next round}}

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it.
A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward.
When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle.
The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries.
If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.
A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap.
If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends.
The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can.
If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day.
If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.
A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.
You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.
If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does.
The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can.
The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure.
Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check.
The DM makes this check secretly.
If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective.
You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.
This task also takes 10 full minutes.
If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell.
The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level.
A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.
If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5.
The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&#8212;even a straw laid across it.
However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.
This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa}}

Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone.
For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.
For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it.
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.
For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user.
Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item&#8212;

When you cast this spell, you select one of two variants.
Send Yourself: You teleport yourself, your gear, and your special mount (if any).
You do not designate a destination; you are automatically transported to the nearest location on the same plane where your talents as a holy soldier are needed.
There is always at least one evil creature (or one creature committing an evil act) at this location.
Fighting this creature or creatures is always an appropriate action&#8212;you are not required to parley, and killing such creatures is always justified according to the rules of your faith.
The encounter level is less than or equal to your character level minus 2; thus, if you are a 14th-level paladin, you face an encounter of EL 12 or below.
If you are of a race that has a level adjustment (such as a dark elf ), use your effective character level instead of your actual character level for the purpose of determining the encounter level for this spell.
Door to great evil guarantees safe arrival for you (on solid ground, not within a raging fire or underwater, no chance of a mishap, and so on), but it does not provide you with a way to return.
You do, however, have a vague awareness of the distance traveled and know the direction you must go to return to the location where the spell was cast.
Send Another: This version of the spell functions as above, except that instead of teleporting yourself, you send another willing paladin with her gear and special mount (if any) in your place.
The challenge to the paladin is based on her character level, not yours.
All other factors in the spell description above that refer to &quot;you&quot; instead refer to the target paladin in this version.
This spell is a favorite of paladins of Aluvan and Dracanish, and of Durann to a lesser extent.

This seed of life grants the subject fast healing 2 for the duration of the spell, in much the same way as vigor.
At any point before the duration expires, the subject can exhaust the remaining positive energy in a sudden burst of healing as a standard action.
When this option is exercised, roll a number of d4s equal to one-half the spell's remaining duration, rounded down (for example, 5d4 if the spell has 11 rounds remaining).
The result is the number of hit points of damage instantly healed.
Using this option ends the spell immediately}}
