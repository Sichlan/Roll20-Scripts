The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.
Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you.  It advances and awaits your bidding.  You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain).  The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own.  You can attach some small item or note to the messenger.  The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.  Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored.  The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example)}}

The normal caster level limit for individual spells still applies; thus, a 3rd-level cleric with 6 ranks in Heal when under the effect of healing lorecall cures 1d8+5 points of damage with a cure light wounds spell.

Based on an assessment of your immediate surroundings and chosen path of travel, you receive one of three visions that reflect the next hour's journey: safety, peril, or great danger.
The base chance for receiving an accurate reply is 70% +1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly.
If the omen of peril is successful, you get one of three visions, which lasts just a second or two.
<ul><li>Safety: You aren't in any immediate danger. If you continue on your present course (or remain where you are if you have been stationary for some time before casting the spell), you will face no significant monsters, traps, or other challenges for the next hour or so.</li></ul><ul><li>Peril: You will face challenges typical of an adventure: challenging but not overwhelming monsters, dangerous traps, and other hazards for the next hour or so.</li></ul><ul><li>Great Danger: Your very life is at grave risk. You will likely face powerful NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour.</li></ul>If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don't necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly.
Choosing which vision is &quot;correct&quot; takes some educated guesswork on the part of the DM, who should assess the characters' likely courses of action and what dangers they're likely to face.
The exact form that an omen of peril takes depends on whether you worship a specific deity, venerate nature as a druid, or simply uphold abstract principles. A druid might see a white dove for safety, a dark cloud obscuring the sun for peril, and a forest fire for great danger. A cleric of Fharlanghn might get a vision of a straight road for safety, a crossroads for peril, and a washed-out bridge for great danger.
Unlike the more powerful <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/augury--2478/">**augury**</a> spell (PH 202), an omen of peril doesn't respond to a specific question. It indicates only the level of danger likely for the next hour, not what form the danger will take.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you can balance on vertical surfaces; the normal modifier for a sloped or angled surface no longer applies to you, though other DC modifiers (such as for a slippery surface) do apply. If you balance on a vertical surface, you can move up or down as if you were climbing. However, you are not actually climbing, so you can make attacks normally, retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and generally follow the rules of the Balance skill rather than the Climb skill.
If you have 10 or more ranks in Balance, you can balance on liquids, semisolid surfaces such as mud or snow, or similar surfaces that normally couldn't support your weight. For each consecutive round that you begin balanced on a particular surface of this sort, the DC of your Balance check increases by 5. As with all uses of the Balance skill, you move at half speed unless you decide to use the accelerated movement option (thereby increasing the DC of the Balance check by 5)}}

When you cast this spell, you trace the cerulean sign in the air with a hand, leaving a glowing blue rune in the air for a
brief moment before it flashes and fills the area of effect with a pulse of cerulean light.
Any aberration within the area must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the following ill effects.
Closer aberrations are affected first.
Each effect lasts for 1 round.
None: The aberration suffers no ill effect, even if it fails the
saving throw.
Sickened: The aberration takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round.
Nauseated: The aberration cannot attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything but take a single move action for 1 round.
Dazed: The aberration can take no actions, but has no penalty to its Armor Class, for 1 round.
Stunned: The aberration drops everything held, can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round.
Once a creature recovers from an effect, it moves up one level on the table.
Thus, a creature that is stunned by this spell is dazed the round after that, nauseated the round after that, sickened the round after that, and then recovers fully the next round}}

For all intents and purposes, you no longer exist while merged with the animal, and you cannot be detected or affected by anything as long as you remain within it.
While melded with the animal, you mentally direct its actions. You can make it attack, run, or take any other action it could normally physically accomplish. However, because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it can undertake actions normally beyond its own instincts (such as manipulating objects with its claws or mouth). Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger) are ignored. You receive direct sensory input from the creature using its normal senses and skill modifiers.
You cannot take any mental actions while within the animal other than directing it or dismissing the effect (such that you cannot manifest a psionic power or cast a spell, even if it has no components).
Injury to the animal has no effect on you. If the animal is killed, if the spell is dispelled or dismissed, or if the spell's duration expires, you appear (as if leaping forth from the animal) in an open space of your choice within 10 feet of the animal's position. If no open space exists, you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet so moved.

The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope.

One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
(The head of a worm or a snake could be thus ensnared, for example).
If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it.
The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs.
If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
The snare is magical.
To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action.
The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points.

A 5th-level caster can create a wall up to 50 feet long and up to 25 feet high, sufficient to form a cylinder of wind 15 feet in diameter.

You create a plume of smoke that you capture in a special bottle you're holding. If the bottle is thereafter opened before the spell duration expires, the smoke emerges to form a vaguely horselike creature made of wisps of smoke. It makes no sound, and anything that touches it simply passes through it.
To mount this smoke horse, the would-be rider must make a DC 10 Ride check while holding the bottle in one hand. Anyone attempting to mount without the bottle simply passes through the horse's form. Letting go of the bottle after mounting causes the rider to fall through the horse's smoky form; he or she cannot thereafter remount without the intact bottle in hand. If the bottle is broken, the spell ends immediately and the rider (if mounted) falls to the ground.
The smoke horse has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can send smoke billowing out behind it at the rider's behest, leaving behind a bank of smoke 5 feet wide and 20 feet high as it moves. A severe wind, or magical wind of any kind, disperses the horse (and any smoke it has produced) instantly. Otherwise, the bank of smoke lasts 10 minutes, starting on the turn it was laid down. Starting or stopping the smoke trail is a free action. The mount and the smoke trail it produces give concealment to anyone behind them.
The mount is immune to all damage and other attacks because material objects and spells simply pass through it. It cannot attack.
The rider can return the smoke horse to the bottle, and thus pause the spell, at any time by simply uncorking it (a move action) and stoppering it again (another move action) in the next round after the horse is inside. If the bottle is reopened later, the spell reactivates with its remaining duration intact. Regardless of how much duration remains unused, the spell ceases functioning 24 hours after it is cast. If dispelled at any time while the bottle is corked, the spell ends}}

Artificial structures or features are not affected, although nature's rampart could be positioned to fill a gap between two buildings or barricade an unpaved road. The effect of the spell depends on the terrain:
<strong>Open Outdoor Site:</strong> A rampart or dike of earth 5 feet high and 5 feet thick at its base rises immediately behind a shallow ditch 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep along the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the dike receive cover. Attackers approaching on foot must scramble down into the ditch and then climbing 10 feet to reach the top of the dike (Climb DC 10).
<strong>Rough Outdoor Site or Cavern:</strong> Loose stones and boulders, dead wood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall 5 feet high and 2 feet thick at the base around the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the wall receive cover.
<strong>Marshy or Low-Lying Site:</strong> In areas such as marsh, bog, swamp, or tundra, nature's rampart cannot raise a wall, but instead creates a water-filled ditch 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep. Creatures forced to wade the ditch are reduced to 1/4 their normal speed (minimum 5 feet) and cannot charge or run.

If the target fails its Will saving throw, you designate a space that the phantasm appears to occupy. The subject must attack the phantasm, or move to be adjacent to it. A creature that attacks the phantasm is allowed an additional saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If moving up to the phantasm would cause the subject to cross dangerous terrain (such as a pool of lava), it does not move to be adjacent to the phantasm. It merely moves as close as it can and takes no further actions unless the phantasm moves to a space it can reach.
As a move action, you can move a phantasmal decoy up to 60 feet in any direction. Because it's not real, a phantasmal decoy isn't affected by terrain that slows movement (although you can slow its progress voluntarily if you like to help maintain the facade of realism)}}

Supernatural sandlike materials, such as black sand or slumber sand, are not affected by the spell.
A creature unable to free itself from the slipsand immediately sinks to the bottom and must hold its breath or begin to suffocate.
If slipsand is cast on a structure of fused sand or on a sandy foundation, it causes the affected part (or more) of the structure to collapse.
If the spell is cast on a building's material, slipsand spreads out to fill the available space, possibly burying those within its area.
The collapsing structure is also dangerous (see Cave-ins and Collapses, page 66 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Slipsand creates a magic trap that is difficult to detect.
A character must succeed on a Survival check (DC equals the save DC of the spell) to notice a pit of slipsand.
Running or charging characters have no chance to detect the trap.
A rogue can find the trap with a successful Search check, but cannot disable it.
The DC is 25 + spell level, or 29 for slipsand.

You can't hold a weapon with your transformed hand, but your other hand can be used to wield  weapons or cast spells with somatic components.
