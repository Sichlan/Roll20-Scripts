This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance.
If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes.
The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.
It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak.
Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell.
Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: &quot;Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within a distance of one foot&quot;.
Triggers react to what appears to be the case.
Disguises and illusions can fool them.
Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does.
Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers.
Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says &quot;Boo&quot;).
Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible.
For example, &quot;Speak when any creature touches the statue&quot;
is an acceptable command if the creature is visible.
A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.
The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.
Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.
Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell}}

If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), Nystul's magic aura doesn't work.

Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour.
The effects are minor and have severe limitations.
A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material.
It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round.
It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters.
Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial.
The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.
Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.
Characters typically use prestidigitation spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives.
Common tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs}}

You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute.

The new form must be within one size category of your normal size.  The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level.  You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.  You retain your own ability scores.  Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same.
You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.  Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.  You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind.  The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell}}

Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).

You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.
Blinking has several effects, as follows.
Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible.
If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).
If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%.
(For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance).
Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.
Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures.
Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.
While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.
You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects.
For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material.
If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.
You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material).
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.
You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost.
An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down.
As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial.
Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally.
Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.
An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack.
Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material}}

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

This extra speed has several effects.
When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round).
A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.
Multiple haste effects don't stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw.
A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation.
Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast.
The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.
Typical suggestions include &quot;Close the book and leave&quot;, &quot;Forget the existence of the book&quot;, and so forth.

If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4&#215;10 minutes.
If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth.
When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind.
These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known.
If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information.
As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are &quot;legendary&quot;, as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.
Examples of legend lore results include the following.
A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: &quot;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones.
Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'
on the lips&quot;.
A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: &quot;Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life.
He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain&quot;.
(The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain).
A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: &quot;The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods.
Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day&quot;.
(These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore)}}

You turn two ordinary coins into magic listening devices&#8212;one a sensor and the other a receiver. After casting the spell, you simply give the sensor coin away, either surreptitiously or overtly. By holding the receiver coin up to your ear, you can hear whatever transpires near the sensor as if you were there (much like a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/clairaudienceclairvoyance--2479/">clairaudience</a> effect). If the sensor coin is in a pocket, pouch, or sack, the DC of the Listen check increases by 5.

You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range.
You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.
The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) or a specific creature known to you.
It cannot find a creature of a certain type (such as humanoid or animal).
To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.
Running water blocks the spell.
It cannot detect objects.
It can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells.

Rainbow pattern fascinates a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures.
Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.
Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first.
An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern.
With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin).
All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect.
Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it.
If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), each fascinated creature gets a second save.
If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscuring mist spell, for instance), creatures who can't see them are no longer affected.
The spell does not affect sightless creatures.
Verbal Component: A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must sing, play music, or recite a rhyme as a verbal component.

Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.
Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.
Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.
Spells that deal damage, such as Melf's acid arrow, have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save.
Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack.
If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur.
Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.
In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not.
Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mist, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.
Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.
A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy).
It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses.
Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work.
(Roll for each use and each affected character separately).
Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11).
A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.
Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell}}

You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from plants.
A regular plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.
The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments.
If a plant creature is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you (as determined by the DM)}}

Using material from the Plane of Shadow, you can fashion a quasi-real melee weapon of any type with which you are proficient. This spectral weapon appears in your hand and behaves as a normal weapon of its type, with two exceptions. First, you resolve attacks with your spectral weapon as melee touch attacks instead of melee attacks. Second, any foe you hit is entitled to a Will save to recognize the  weapon's shadowy, semi-insubstantial nature. If the save is successful, that opponent takes only half damage from the weapon on that attack and all subsequent attacks, and is only 50% likely to suffer any special effects of your attacks (such as a death attack delivered with the weapon).
You can maintain only one spectral weapon at a time, and only you can wield it. The weapon dissipates when you let go of it or when the spell's duration expires, whichever comes first}}
