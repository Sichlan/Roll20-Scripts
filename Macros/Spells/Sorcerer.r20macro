As you intone the spell, the script appears on a sheet of paper close at hand.
You cause writing from one source (such as a book) to be copied into a book, paper, or parchment. This spell copies 250 words per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell copies only nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook, a spell scroll, or a sepia snake sigil). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with explosive runes), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied.
The spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied.
Blank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If the target has  multiple pages, the spell automatically turns to the next blank page whenever necessary. If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of
blank pages. At any time during the spell's duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another  target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages. 
The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy}}

If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.
See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark.

Coppery sparks spring from your palm, filling the corridor with small four-pronged spikes.**
A **caltrops** spell covers one 5-foot-by-5-foor square with caltrops. Every time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area, it might step on one. The caltrops make one attack roll (+0 melee) against the creature. For this attack, the target 's shield and deflection bonuses do not count, nor does its armor bonus for armor worn. A target  wearing shoes or other footwear gains a +2 armor bonus to Armor Class (which does count). If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one.
A successful attack by a caltrop deals 1 point of damage. If the target is Small, Medium, or Large, its land speed is reduced by one half because of the injury. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours,  until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.
The DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents or opponents outside the size range given above. A giant centipede, for example, can scramble among the caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing thick, massive boots might be immune to their attacks.
For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you can affect an additional 5-foot-by-5-foot square, and the caltrops' attack bonus increases by 1. Thus, you affect two squares at 3rd level (+1 melee), three at 5th level (+2 melee), four at 7th level (+3 melee), and a maximum of five at 9th level or higher (+4 melee maximum).
Multiple **caltrops** spells (or mundane caltrops) occupying the same space have no additional effect}}

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

This spell is normally used to launch dangerous items (flasks of acid, thunderstones, and so on) farther than you could normally throw them. You can use this spell to make an attack with a splash weapon. If you choose to do so, you must make an attack roll as normal, but you suffer no penalties for range}}

Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour.
The effects are minor and have severe limitations.
A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material.
It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round.
It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters.
Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial.
The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.
Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.
Characters typically use prestidigitation spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives.
Common tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs}}

Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inchdiameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled.

At one point during the duration of this spell, you can attempt to alter the outcome of a game of chance. This spell can affect only nonmagical games, such as those using cards or dice. It cannot affect a game involving magic, nor a magic item involved in a game of chance (such as a **deck of many things**).

Anyone observing the game of chance is allowed a Will saving throw to realize something fishy is going on, and might suspect that the outcome of the game has been magically altered. For example, Darkon is playing a game that he has a 1 in 4 chance of winning. The DM secretly rolls 1d4 and tells the player that Darkon lost. Because Darkon is under the effect of a **cheat** spell, the player can have the DM reroll.

The glow fades, and the space seems strangely larger inside than a normal pocket.**
When you cast this spell, a garment or container becomes a safe haven for a Tiny or smaller familiar. The spell turns the target pocket into a comfortable extradimensional space (about 1 cubic foot). The familiar can fit inside the space without creating any noticeable bulge in the item. Whenever the familiar is touching you, you can whisk it inside the space as a free action by speaking a command word chosen by you when the spell is cast. If the familiar can speak, it can command itself inside. As a free action, you can call the familiar forth or it can leave the space on its own.
Once inside, the familiar has total cover and total concealment, and as a free action, you or the familiar can further seal the space to make it airtight and waterproof. The air supply inside the sealed space lasts for 1 hour, but with the pocket unsealed, the familiar can remain inside indefinitely. The familiar cannot attack or cast spells from within the space, but can use supernatural or spell-like abilities as normal (provided they don't require line of sight, which the pocket blocks). You continue to gain the special ability granted by your familiar. While inside the pocket, the familiar continues to benefit from the share spells ability as if it were adjacent to you.
The spell ends if the **familiar pocket** is placed within or taken into another extradimensional space (such as a **portable hole**). If your familiar is within the pocket when the spell duration expires or if the spell ends abnormally (as above), the familiar appears in your space unharmed.
**Material Component:** A tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth given a half twist and fastened at the ends}}

Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a
fall froma few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect.
However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall.
Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.
You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn.
This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance.
If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.
(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on falling objects).
Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects.
It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature}}

A creature that has a special saving throw bonus against poison may apply that to its saving throw against this spell.
Creatures immune to poison are unaffected by fetid breath.

In addition, you gain the ability to make one natural slam attack, dealing 1d6 points of damage + your new Strength bonus (or 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus if you make no other attacks in that round). You can make the slam attack as a natural secondary attack, with the normal -5 penalty, or a -2 penalty if you have the Multiattack feat (**MM** 304), as part of a full attack action. However, you cannot gain more than one slam attack per round with this spell due to a high base attack bonus (+6 or higher).
Your fist undergoes no change in size or form, remaining as flexible and responsive as it would normally be while under the spell's effect.

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area.
A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details). 
The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not). 
The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item&#8212;a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.
A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin. Material Component: A bit of pork rind or butter}}

You gain a magical second stomach, which can be used to transport objects securely.
You can safely swallow and transport any object you could normally swallow (including items at least three size categories smaller than you).
The capacity of your hoard gullet is 100 pounds and/or 10 cubic feet per caster level (up to a maximum of 1,000 pounds and 100 cubic feet).
You can't remove individual items from your hoard gullet, but as a full-round action, you can expel its entire contents into your square.
It otherwise functions as a bag of holding (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 248).
At the end of the spell's duration, anything still in your second stomach is immediately and instantly brought up, falling to the ground next to you.
You can't have more than one hoard gullet active at one time; casting this spell before its duration ends the duration of the previous casting.
For example, if a 7th-level sorcerer with 2 hours left on his hoard guild casts the spell again, the spell's duration resets to 7 hours.
Dragons often use this spell to transport their treasure hoards safely, but it is equally useful to those who would loot such hoards}}

First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.
Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

With a sizzle and a flash, those within the spell's radius disappear, then reappear somewhere nearby.
The scramble true position spell can wreck an enemy's carefully constructed defenses or highly regarded plan of attack by randomly moving them around.
You can't control where your enemies reappear, but they might fall off a precipice or wind up between your rogue and fighter allies.
When you cast the spell, make a single Truespeak check.
Then compare your result to the DC to move each creature: 15 + (2 x CR).
If you meet or exceed the DC for a creature, move that creature 2 squares in a random direction using the &quot;targeted on square&quot; part of the diagram on page 158 of the Player's Handbook.
The scramble true position spell can't send a creature into a square occupied by solid matter or another creature, but it can send a creature into a dangerous place (into lava or off a cliff, for example).
Make the comparison and movement in descending CR order.
If multiple targets have the same CR, the caster chooses the order in which to relocate them.
If you can't move a target 2 squares in a particular direction, move it 1 square, or it disappears and reappears in the same square if relocation is impossible.
Having their true locations disrupted with this spell can be disorienting for the subjects.
Every creature that you move with this spell (even those who reappear in the same square they started in) must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the truenames for cardinal directions and movement, which you learn with the spell.
This check has no set DC, but if your Truespeak check result is lower than 15 + (2 x creature's CR) for the lowest CR creature in the area, then scramble true position has no effect}}

Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.
Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first.
Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
For example, Mialee casts sleep at one rat (1/4 HD), one kobold (1 HD), two gnolls (2 HD), and an ogre (4 HD).
The rat, the kobold, and one gnoll are affected (1/4 + 1 + 2 = 3-1/4 HD).
The remaining 3/4 HD is not enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre.
Mialee can't choose to have sleep affect the ogre or the two gnolls.
Sleeping creatures are helpless.
Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).
Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

The feeling passes as you designate the area of the spell, where the flames there flicker for a moment as if a gust of wind had hit them.**
This spell lends fuel to existing fires within the spell's area, allowing them to burn off the intangible power of passion as much as from physical substance. Because these fires consume less of the physical fuel that sustain them, they burn for twice as long without losing any of their intensity, but their illumination radius is halved.
In addition, an affected fire is much harder to extinguish. It takes twice as long to put out a fire that is under the effect of this spell, and if a roll is required (such as the Reflex save required to extinguish flames if a creature is on fire), two successful rolls over 2 rounds are required to successfully put out the fire. If one such roll fails, the creature must begin trying to extinguish the flames again as if it had never succeeded on the first roll.
Magical fire used against a target in this spell's area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, does not burn as effectively, and fire damage from such sources is reduced by 1 point per die.
Slow burn counters or dispels the effect of <a href="/spells/spell-compendium--86/raging-flame--4055/">**raging flame**</a> (page 164).

You are able to hold the charge for one touch spell per arm of your body as long as you don't use a changed limb to cast another spell or touch anything with it. Each touch spell you cast resides in a different forelimb. For the duration of this spell, any touch spells you cast are discharged only if you cast another spell with that forelimb or touch something with that forelimb.
For example, a human sorcerer casts this spell, then casts chill touch and holds the charge in his left hand, then casts shocking grasp and holds the charge in his right hand. Because of the spell flower, he can hold the charge on both of these spells at the same time. If he casts another spell with a somatic component (which requires the use of one of his hands), he immediately loses one of his held touch  spells (his choice), but if the spell he casts is also a touch spell, he can immediately hold the charge in the available hand. If he chooses to attack with a touch spell, it works normally. Since he has multiple limbs that are considered armed, he can make an off-hand attack with the other touch spell in the same round, with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons (PH 160).
A marilith spellcaster could do the same as the sorcerer in the previous example, except that she could  hold the charge on up to six touch spells. She could also use any of her spell-like or supernatural  bilities, since those do not interfere with holding a charge.
If the spell flower effect ends, the most recent touch spell cast remains as a held charge and all other held spells dissipate}}

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, a summon monster I is a lawful and evil spell when cast to summon a fiendish dire rat.

A weapon shift spell allows you to temporarily transform any one melee weapon into a different melee weapon. Thus, a greatclub could be transformed into a greatsword, a light pick into a morning star, or a dagger into a battleaxe.
Improvised weapons and double weapons cannot be targeted or be the result of this spell. Magic weapons transformed retain all their special abilities as long as the new form could legally have those abilities, and weapons made from special materials retain their special materials.

You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.  You retain your own ability scores.  Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same.
You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.  Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.  You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind.  The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

You gain a +4 insight bonus on Balance checks. If you have sufficient ranks in the Balance skill, you can even balance on an otherwise-impossible surface with a DC 20 Balance check.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you can balance on vertical surfaces; the normal modifier for a sloped or angled surface no longer applies to you, though other DC modifiers (such as for a slippery surface) do apply. If you balance on a vertical surface, you can move up or down as if you were climbing. However, you are not actually climbing, so you can make attacks normally, retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and generally follow the rules of the Balance skill rather than the Climb skill.
If you have 10 or more ranks in Balance, you can balance on liquids, semisolid surfaces such as mud or snow, or similar surfaces that normally couldn't support your weight. For each consecutive round that you begin balanced on a particular surface of this sort, the DC of your Balance check increases by 5.

(Retries are not allowed).
An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing (see charm person).
A nonintelligent undead creature (such as a skeleton or zombie) gets no saving throw against this spell.
When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;come here&quot;, &quot;go there&quot;, &quot;fight&quot;, &quot;stand still&quot;, and so on.
Nonintelligent undead won't resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.
Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell.

This spell creates a single magic tattoo. You determine the exact type of tattoo, though the selection is limited by your caster level, as indicated below. You must possess a modicum of artistic talent to sketch the desired tattoo &#8211; at least 1 rank on Craft (drawing), Craft (painting), Craft (calligraphy), or a similar Craft skill. Inscribing a magic tattoo requires a successful Craft check. The DC varies with the kind of tattoo, as noted below.
If you are a 3rd- to 6th-level caster, you can inscribe a tattoo that generates any one of the following effects (Craft DC 10).
*+2 resistance bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will).*+1 luck bonus on attack rolls.*+1 deflection bonus to AC.
At 7th to 12th caster level, you can add the following tattoos to the list that you can inscribe (Craft DC 15).
*+2 resistance bonus on saving throws.*+2 competence bonus on attack rolls.
When your caster level reaches 13th, you can add the following to the list of tattoos you can inscribe (Craft DC 20).
*Spell resistance equal to 10 + 1 per three caster levels.*+2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score*+1 spellcaster level. This effect increases the subject's effective level, but not the total number of spells.

A single creature can have only three magic tattoos at a time. Any attempt to apply more than that automatically fails.

The spell makes any action the subject considers attempting seem easily accomplished, requiring only a token effort. Deadly wounds seem like mere scratches, stalwart foes appear weak and intimidated, and the subject's own attacks seem stronger and more effective. As a result of its skewed perceptions, the subject takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks, as well as to Wisdom. This penalty cannot reduce the subject's Wisdom below 1.

A globe of supernaturally dry air rolls in whichever direction you point and engulfs those it strkes. It moves 30 feet per tound and can lea up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d4 points of damage as it evaporates moisture from the subject. (The subject can negate this damage with a successful Reflex save). Oozes, creatures composed of water (such as water elementals), and creatures with the aquatic subtype take 2d6 points of damage.
The bubble moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest. The surface of the bubble has a spongy, yielding consistency (similar to that of a soap bubble, but not fragile and allowing objects to pass through it without affecting the spell) and so does not cause damage except by absorbing moisture. It cannot batter down large obstacles. The bubble winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

You make one undead&#8212;including its clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment&#8212;look different. You can make it seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change the creature's body type. For example, a wight could look human, humanoid, or like any other generally human-shaped bipedal creature. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature, such as a mole or a beard, or make it look like an entirely different creature.
The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. It does not alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the undead or its equipment. A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe.
This spell also foils magical means of detecting undead. The subject of **disguise undead** detects as a creature of the type simulated.

Immediately the sides of the cavern begin to contract, sealing the passage behind you.**
You cause a 1-foot length of subterranean tunnel to constrict, "locking" it against others who might wish to traverse its length. This spell affects only naturally occurring tunnels or worked tunnels that are surrounded on all sides by unworked, natural, subterranean earth. You can affect any tunnel whose diameter does not exceed 10 feet. A square-sided or rough tunnel can also be affected, as long as its diameter at the point where the spell is cast does not exceed 10 feet.
The constriction takes 1 round to complete. Any Large or smaller object or creature that partially blocks the constrictions point is pushed, unharmed, to one side or the other. (A creature can decides which way to move; an object moves randomly.) A Huge or larger object or creature that blocks the constricted point prevents the spell from working until moved.
You can freely pass through tunnels that you have secured with this spell. (The constriction opens and closes on your command, taking 1 round for either process). A tunnel secured with **earth lock** can be bypassed by others in several ways. A DC 20 Escape Artist check allows the creature making the check to squeeze through the constriction but leaves it intact. A DC 25 Strength check breaks the constriction and ends the spell. A successful **dispel magic** or **knock** spell opens the constriction - the former by ending the spell and the latter by suppressing it for 10 minutes. If a creature burrows through the **earth lock**, the spell ends. The constricted tunnel can also be dug out normally.
Identifying a tunnel secured with **earth lock** (as opposed to a tunnel that just ends) requires a DC 20 Search check}}

Treat the arm as a Medium creature, with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength of 14 +2 per three caster levels (16 at 3rd level, 18 at 6th level, and so on). The arm doesn't move from the square it appears in, but can make one grapple attempt per round against any creature in its square or any adjacent square. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the arm can target multiple creatures, you choose one. If you are unable to choose a target, the arm attacks a random creature within reach (possibly including your allies). Each round when it successfully pins a target, the hand deals lethal damage equal to 1d6 points + its Str modifier.
The earthen arm has AC 15, hardness 4, and 3 hit points per caster level. If reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to dust.

You cause a creature's multiple arms or tentacles to fuse together into a single pair of stronger limbs. Only limbs that the creature can use as arms or grasping limbs are affected by the spell (so basilisks and monstrous centipedes, neither or which use their limbs to attack or manipulate objects, are unaffected).

For example, a girallon under the effect of this spell would have one pair of arms and Strength 26 for the purpose of using those arms. A behir, which has three pairs of limbs that it can use as arms, would end up with one pair of arm-limbs with a +8 bonus to Strength for those arms (its six legs would be unaffected).
The loss of limbs might reduce the number of attacks available to the subject.

Conditions for triggering a **ghoul glyph** are stringent. It takes effect on any creature except yourself that moves within 5 feet. It affects invisible creatures normally but is not triggered by those that travel past it ethereally. Only a single **ghoul glyph** can be inscribed in a 5-foot square.

**Read magic** allows identification of a **ghoul glyph** with a successful DC 13 Spellcraft check, if the glyph is noticed before it is activated. A rogue can use the Search skill to find a **ghoul glyph** and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 27.

The hurl spell enhances one melee weapon so that it returns to the thrower after being thrown. For the duration of the spell, when thrown, the weapon returns to its wielder at the beginning of the wielder's next action. The weapon returns whether it hit or missed its target. On its return, the thrown weapon hovers for 1 round next to the wielder and can then be seized and thrown again. After 1 round, the weapon falls to the ground. The weapon returns to its wielder only if thrown; it doesn't automatically fly back if dropped or seized by another creature. (An improvised weapon or a weapon not designed for throwing has a range increment of 10 feet.) Throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action}}

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell}}

As a primary attack, it adds the creature's Strength modifier to damage. It can also be used as a secondary natural attack in conjunction with a manufactured weapon. Such secondary attacks do not interfere with the primary attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon would do, but the subject takes the usual &#8212;5 penalty (or &#8212;2 with the <a href="/feats/monster-manual-v35--5/multiattack--1997/">Multiattack</a> feat) for the bite attack when used as a secondary natural attack.
If the subject hits with its bite attack, it attaches itself to the foe and deals automatic bite damage each round it remains attached. It does not need to make a grapple check, and it does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An attached attacker loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. It cannot use other weapons while attached, but each attack upon from the grappled foe requires a successful grapple check. Others can attack an attached creature with a weapon or grapple. To remove the attached creature through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against it.
A creature with a natural bite attack can use its own bite damage, if greater, but still gains the ability to attach itself.

Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.

A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot

Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes.
The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.
It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak.
Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell.
Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: &quot;Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within a distance of one foot&quot;.
Triggers react to what appears to be the case.
Disguises and illusions can fool them.
Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does.
Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers.
Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says &quot;Boo&quot;).
Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible.
For example, &quot;Speak when any creature touches the statue&quot;
is an acceptable command if the creature is visible.
A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.
The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.
Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

An aura of bright energy forms around you, coalescing into the shape of a translucent dragon above your head.
This spell grants you a variety of benefits related to your draconic feats.
If you have no draconic feats, this spell has no effect.
While this spell is active, you are considered to have two more draconic feats than normal for the purpose of determining the benefit of your draconic feats.
For example, if you have the Draconic Heritage feat (see page 17), you would gain a +2 bonus to the specified saves for the duration of this spell, over and above the bonus already granted by that feat.
In addition, for the purpose of determining the benefit of a draconic feat, treat magic of the dragonheart as if its spell level equaled 1/2 your caster level.
For example, an 8th-level sorcerer that has the Draconic Flight feat (Complete Arcane 77) would gain a fly speed of 40 feet after casting this spell, as if it were a 4th-level spell.
Finally, you gain a competence bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level (maximum +10) on skill checks made with the class skill granted by your Draconic Heritage feat (if you have the feat)}}

You fill the subject with so great a rage that it can do nothing but focus on engaging you in personal physical combat. The target must be able to see you when you cast this spell. If the subject later loses line of sight to you, the spell immediately ends. (A subject can't voluntarily break line of sight with you, such as by closing its eyes, to end this spell prematurely.)
If the subject threatens you, it must make a full attack against you using a melee weapon or a natural weapon. If the subject doesn't threaten you at the start of its turn, it must move toward you (taking nothing but move actions) and end its movement as close to you as possible. If it gets close enough with a single move action to threaten you, it stops and makes a melee attack against you as normal.
While under the effect of a mindless rage spell, the subject can make use of all its normal melee combat skills, abilities, and feats&#8212;either offensive or defensive. However, the subject can't make ranged attacks, cast spells, or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger, or spell completion to function. The subject can't make any attack against a creature other than you.
The subject of this spell, though overcome with rage, is by no means rendered idiotic or suicidal. For example, an affected creature will not charge off a cliff in an attempt to reach you.
An interesting side effect of mindless rage occurs when the spell affects any character or creature that has the rage ability (such as a barbarian). In these cases, the mindless rage spell automatically activates the creature's rage ability (and counts as one of the creature's uses of rage for that day)}}

You can move into and through a mirror image.
When you and the mirror image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image.
The figments may also move through each other.
The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets.
Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment.

Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).

If the target creature fails its saving throw, this spell creates in the subject's mind an illusory double of whichever creature currently threatens it that it deems most dangerous. The form of this phantom foe changes as appropriate whenever the target perceives a different threatening creature more dangerous than the last. This illusory double provides two effects.
First, the subject believes it is being flanked by the phantom foe and the real creature the foe duplicates. Thus, the duplicated creature is always considered to be flanking the subject in melee. A creature that can't be flanked is immune to this aspect of the spell.
Second, the subject of the spell is unable to determine that the phantom foe is not a real threat, and whenever the subject attempts to attack the creature duplicated by the phantom foe, that creature benefits from a 50% miss chance against attacks from the subject of the spell. Because this miss chance comes from the subject's inability to tell the phantom foe from the original, it is rolled separately from any miss chance that applies due to displacement or concealment.
Creatures other than the subject cannot see the phantom foe, although they can attempt to guess its location by how the target acts. If the subject is not threatened by any creature at the start of its turn, the spell ends}}

Portal alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size passes through the magic gate or portal the spell is cast upon. You decide at the time of casting whether the portal alarm will be mental or audible.
<strong>Mental Alarm:</strong> A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) as long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area and on the same plane. You notice a mental tremor that would awaken you from a normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration (it would not interfere with spellcasting). A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.
<strong>Audible Alarm:</strong> An audible portal alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, buzzer, or other similar repeating sound that can be heard clearly up to 60 feet away, and it pierces closed doors and extends onto other planes. The ringing can be heard faintly up to 180 feet away and lasts for 1 round. Creatures within the area of a silence spell cannot hear the ringing, and if the portal itself is within the area of a silence spell, no alarm is sounded.
Ethereal and astral creatures trigger a portal alarm if they pass through the portal.
You can set a portal alarm with a password, determined at the time of the casting, and this password can be discerned with the <a href="/spells/spell-compendium--86/analyze-portal--3826/">**analyze portal**</a> spell (page 10). Those speaking the password before passing through the portal do not set off the alarm.

This spell only works on a portal you are able to activate; for example, if you are an elf and the target portal doesn't work for elves, you can't use this spell on the portal.
The extradimensional space created by this spell is similar to that created by a rope trick spell but can only hold you and your gear (up to your maximum heavy load).
When the spell ends, you exit the portal at either your point of entry or the portal's destination.
While within this extradimensional space, you can see the origin and destination locations, though the images are blurry (much like viewing the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane).
Dispel magic or gate seal traps you within the extradimensional space for as long as the portal is negated or sealed (as would surrounding both ends with a dead magic area).
Mordenkainen's disjunction or some other effect that destroys a portal outright forcibly ejects you from one random end of the portal and deals 5d6 points of damage to you.

find elsewhere.

Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights.
This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).
These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected.
Spell resistance can prevent blindness.
Smoke Cloud: A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud.
The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level.
All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud.
All within the cloud take -4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates).
These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud.
Spell resistance does not apply.
Material Component: The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished.
A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished.
Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level}}

All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell.
Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.
Alternatively, you can target shatter against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level.

On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed.
(The hit points can be healed as normal).
For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand.
The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack.
The hand always strikes from your direction.
The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can.
After it delivers a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers.
The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons.
It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of at least 22.
Your Intelligence modifier applies to the hand's AC as if it were the hand's Dexterity modifier.
The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it}}

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. When this ray successfully strikes, it creates a sensation of many tiny insects biting and crawling on the victim's body. The target can attempt a Will save each round to shake off the effect. Until the spell is shrugged off, the victim is hampered by the unsettling feeling of all the stinging and biting, and is able to perform only a single move or standard action each round. The victim also takes a -2 penalty to AC. In addition, if the victim attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check with a DC equal to the sting ray's DC + the level of the spell the subject is attempting to cast. For example, if a 6th-level sorcerer with a Charisma score of 16 casts sting ray on a wizard casting a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a>, the Concentration check DC is 19 (16 [sting ray DC] + 3 [fireball spell level]).
A successful Will save negates the effect restricting the subject's action to one move or one standard action each round, nor does the subject need to make a Concentration check each time it wishes to cast a spell. However, the subject still takes the penalty to AC for the duration of the spell with a successful save.

These strands trap those caught in them.
The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher.
These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points&#8212;floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like&#8212;or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears.
Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers.
Attacking a creature in a web won't cause you to become entangled.
Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save.
If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below).
If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check.
Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly.
Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check.
The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover.
If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover (see Cover, page 150).
The strands of a web spell are flammable.
A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs.
Any fire&#8212;a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth&#8212;can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round.
All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

You hurl a weapon held at the time of casting, and it magically attacks all enemies along a line to the extent of the spell's range. You make a normal melee attack, just as if you were attacking with the weapon in melee, against each foe in the weapon's path, but you can choose to substitute your Intelligence modifier or your Charisma modifier (as appropriate for your spellcasting class) for your Strength modifier on the weapon's attack rolls and damage rolls. Even if your base attack bonus would normally give you multiple attacks, a whirling blade gets only one attack (at your best attack bonus) against each target. The weapon deals damage just as if you had swung it in melee, including any bonuses you might have from ability scores or feats.

Casting this spell is a swift action. It does not require a move action or standard action, but you can take only one swift, immediate, or quickened action per turn.

The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location.

A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location.
It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound.
Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it.
The wind then dissipates.
You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air.
You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.

The wings of force last just long enough to disrupt your foe's line of effect to you, providing you total cover against a single attack with a weapon, spell, or psionic power.
Your foe's first attack in this round cannot be made and is wasted against you, though he could decide to take any other action, including choosing to attack one of your allies instead, or take a full attack action that grants him additional melee attacks against you in this round (if your foe is of high enough level to have additional attacks).
The wings unfurl and then dissipate an instant later.
Your foe could choose to attack the area in which you have taken cover with an area attack (such as a fireball spell).
In this case, you gain a +8 bonus to AC (if applicable) and a +4 bonus on Reflex saves.

- Whether the portal is one-way or two-way.
- A glimpse of the area where the portal leads. You can look at the area where the portal leads for 1 round; the range of your vision is the spell's range.

- For each property, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 17. If fail, you can try again in the next round. Analyze portal has only a limited ability to reveal unusual properties, as follows.
- Random Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is random and whether it can be activated now. It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning.
- Variable Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is variable. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set.
- Creature-Only Portals: The spell reveals this property. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals where the portal sends creatures. If it is the kind of portal that sends creatures to one place and their equipment to another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes.
- Malfunctioning Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is malfunctioning, not what sort of malfunction the portal produces}}

A weapon affected by this spell gains the ability to move and attack on its own and functions in most ways like an animated object of its size (MM 13).
Treat a light weapon as an object two size categories smaller than its wielder, a one-handed weapon as one size category smaller than its wielder, and a two-handed weapon as an object of the same size as its wielder.
However, the weapon deals its normal damage, not the damage noted for an animated object of its size, and it gains a bonus on attack rolls equal to the ability modifier used to set your spell save DCs.
Diminutive or smaller objects are unaffected by the spell.
An animated weapon attacks the nearest enemy to the best of its ability.
You can use a move action to direct it to a different target, but if at the end of your turn you are more than 30 feet from the weapon, the spell ends.
A weapon held or carried by another creature can't be affected by this spell.
The weapon doesn't gain the benefit of any of your class features, feats, or other special abilities that would improve its combat ability.
If the weapon has an enhancement bonus or other special properties, these apply as normal.

As they fade from your hearing, you become more aware of both your surroundings and the possibility of intrusion.**
The subject of the spell is surrounded with an invisible aura that anticipates and delays the teleportation of any creature into the spell's area. Any teleportation spell or effect (including all spells with the teleportation descriptor) can be anticipated, making the spell's recipient instantly aware of the exact location where the teleporting creature will arrive (subject to the restrictions below), the creature's size, and how many other creatures (and their sizes) are arriving with the teleporting creature. The spell also delays the arrival of the teleporting creature by 1 round (so that it arrives on its initiative count immediately before its next turn), generally giving the recipient of the spell and anyone else made aware of the information 1 round to act or ready actions. The teleporting creature does not perceive this delay.
Since a teleporting creature doesn't necessarily arrive at the precise location it intends, the spell also functions against a creature that arrives in range even though its intended destination was elsewhere. For a creature that intends to teleport into range but inadvertently arrives outside the spell's area, the spell gives the recipient awareness that a creature has attempted to teleport into range and delays the creature as normal, but doesn't give any awareness as to the actual location of its imminent arrival.
The spell has no effect on creatures attempting to teleport away from the spell's area, although if their destination is within the area, the spell will affect their reentry as normal}}

The shimmering shape of a warhammer appears before you, ready to be swung.**
This spell creates a powerful aura of pure force that can be wielded as a melee weapon or hurled as an area attack. When the spell is cast, you choose which version of the arcane maul to employ and in which hand to wield the melee version. An arcane maul cannot be first used in melee and then hurled, nor can the melee version be switched from hand to hand.
When used as a melee weapon, an arcane maul acts as a +4 warhammer (1d8 + 4/x3) for 1 round per level, and it can be wielded regardless of proficiency with the warhammer. Used empty-handed, an arcane maul appears as a shim­mering, hammer-shaped force field. When it is used in a hand already holding a weapon, the shimmering force field wraps around both hand and weapon, but all effects of the material weapon (mundane or magic, including damage, bonuses, threat range, and special abilities) are lost for the duration of the spell. An arcane maul can be used with a weapon in your off hand, but the regular penalties for two-weapon fighting apply.
If hurled, an arcane maul shoots out from your fist as a line 50 feet long, then fills a 20-foot-radius burst at the end of its range. Creatures within the area of the line and burst take ld6 points of force damage per two levels (maximum 10d6) and are stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves damage and negates the stun effect.
A hurled arcane maul damages objects in its area. It destroys nonmagical crystal, glass, ceramic, or porce­lain, smashing those substances into dozens of pieces. Objects that weigh more than your caster level in pounds take damage as normal. If the damage caused to an inter­posing barrier shatters or breaks through it, an arcane maul can continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does}}

The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight.
An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (page 219).
If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each.
(Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect).
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.
In some cases, arcane sight may give a deceptively low reading&#8212;for example, when you use it on a spellcaster who has used up most of his or her daily spell allotment.

In a moment you're safe, and you gain a brief respite&#8212;time enough to cast more permanent protective spells.**
You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 150).
Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows a character to breathe water on a water-dominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by avoid planar effects can't be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character's full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don't deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects.
In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects. In the D&amp;D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane.
The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades).
The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won't protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane}}

This spell protects those within its area against a single named foe, doing so in three ways.
First, the area is forbidden to the creature.
It must make a successful Will save to enter it by any means (movement, teleportation spells, and so on).
If it fails its Will save and was endeavoring to use a teleportation spell to enter the area, it is shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 10 feet of the protected area.
If no free space is available within 10 feet, the spell simply fails.
The creature can try to enter the area only once during its turn, but can continue to try on subsequent rounds.
Even if the named creature gets inside the barrier, the other aspects of the spell function normally.
Second, all creatures within the area gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from the named creature, and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws required by the named creature's spell effects and special attacks.
Third, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess or exercise mental control over those within the spell's area by the named creature, including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant ongoing control over the subject.
Bane of the archrival suppresses these effects for the duration of the spell or as long as the subject remains within the spell's area.

Her sleep is frequently interrupted by bed shaking and blanket shifting and the sounds of voices that fade upon waking.
When spellcasting, she suffers a variety of minor irritations that threaten to disrupt her spells, and she constantly feels haunted and watched.
The result of this bedevilment is that she takes a -1 penalty on all ability checks, skill checks, and Will saving throws and has a 5% chance of arcane spell failure (which stacks with any spell failure chance from armor worn).
Detect evil cast upon the subject of this spell reveals the presence of the bedeviling spirit, while protection from evil keeps the spirit from adversely affecting the victim.

You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.
Blinking has several effects, as follows.
Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible.
If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).
If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%.
(For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance).
Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.
Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures.
Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.
While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.
You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects.
For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material.
If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.
You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material).
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.
You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost.
An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down.
As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial.
Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally.
Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.
An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack.
Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material}}

The spell will detect everything from a vein of iron ore to a pile of gold coins, even through solid stone or other barriers.
When you cast this spell, you must concentrate on at least 10 pounds of the metal or mineral you're searching for.
If an accumulation of that metal 10 pounds or larger is within the spell area, you will unerringly sense it (most coins are 50 to the pound).
The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area:
1st Round: Presence or absence of the particular metal or mineral.
2nd Round: Approximate weight of the metal or mineral.
3rd Round: Distance and direction (measured in a straight line) to the metal or mineral.
As long as the spell is active, you can change the metal or mineral you're trying to detect by simply concentrating on a different sample (it takes a standard action to refocus on the new sample).
Thus you could search for gold, then switch to adamantine, then seek out sources of iron.
If you stop concentrating on a sample, the spell ends.
If your sample is unworked, you will detect only unworked accumulations of the metal, such as ore deposits and mineral veins.
You will only detect worked metal, such as gold coins or mithral armor, if your sample is likewise refined.
Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area.
The spell can penetrate any nonmagical solid barrier.

The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting a subject affected by disobedience, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of this spell.
If disobedience ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller becomes able to mentally command the targeted creature.
In addition to protecting the subject, disobedience sends false information to the creature that is attempting to gain control of the subject.
The would-be controller must succeed on a Will save or believe that its spell or ability has taken effect and that the target is now under its control.
The spell's subject becomes aware of commands issued by that creature and can choose to act however she pleases, disregarding the would-be controller's orders or going along with them in a pretense of obedience.

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

This physical manifestation of joy, called ambrosia, can be used in the creation of good magic items, as a special spell component, or as a druglike substance (with no addictive qualities).
The Celestial Hebdomad, the rulers of the Seven Heavens, subsist entirely on ambrosia.
The caster draws ambrosia from the target and contains it within a tiny receptacle, such as a vial.
Ambrosia can only be drawn from a blissful creature; how the creature achieves this state of bliss can vary from one individual to the next.
For example, distilled joy can be cast on a deliriously lovestruck character, a dryad dreaming near her tree, an artist crafting his life's masterpiece, or a character experiencing a moment of rapture or undiluted sexual pleasure.
Good spellcasters can use ambrosia in magic item creation.
Each dose provides the equivalent of 2 experience points needed to create the item.
A dose of ambrosia can also be used as an optional spell component (see Chapter 3).
A living creature that drinks a dose of ambrosia experiences a soothing sensation that wipes away minor aches and pains, takes the edge off grief and sadness, and cures 1 point of damage.
These positive sensations and emotions persist for 1d4+1 hours}}

This spell creates a manifestation of the dreamspace that attacks your enemies. A dream spirit is treated as an incorporeal creature that has your hit points and the AC you would have if you were incorporeal (it loses any armor bonus or natural armor bonus you have but gains a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is greater).
The dream spirit appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. A dream spirit has a single incorporeal touch attack that uses your base attack bonus plus Dexter­ity modifier and deals ld6 points of damage, plus 1 per two levels (maximum 1d6 + 10).
As a free action, you can mentally direct a dream spirit not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The dream spirit acts normally on the last round of the spell's duration and dissipates at the end of its turn.
If a dream spirit is reduced to 0 hit points, this spell ends. If the distance between you and the dream spirit ever exceeds the spell's range, the dream spirit winks out and the spell ends.
Dream spirits are material in nature, and so are not affected by dismissal and similar effects. They are not sub­ject to effects that affect outsiders.}}

Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the **fireball** at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must &quot;hit&quot; the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
The **fireball** sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears.
Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall.

All opponents adjacent to the wall are entangled unless they succeed on Reflex saves.
An opponent must repeat this save each round it remains adjacent to the wall.
Allied creatures are not entangled, and in fact can use the hands to gain a +10 competence bonus on Climb checks to scale the wall.
If the spell ends while you are climbing, you immediately fall but can make a normal Climb check to catch yourself (PH 69).

A creature within 5 feet has concealment.
Creatures farther away have total concealment.

In addition to obscuring sight, the swirling dust abrades any creature within it or attempting to move through it.
Any creature passing through the haze takes 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4), with no save allowed.
If you conjure haboob so that it appears where creatures are located, each creature takes damage as if passing through the haze.
Such creatures take half damage with a successful Reflex save, but if these creatures do not leave the affected area at their next opportunity, they take full damage from the abrading sands (no save) as if they had voluntarily entered the area.
Any creature that remains within the affected area for more than 1 round likewise takes damage automatically (no save).

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round).
A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.

Unlike normal poison, this attack has no secondary damage, though you can continue to &quot;bite&quot; the subject each round.
Immunity or resistance to poison applies normally against this effect, even though it isn't real poison (the subject and his body both believe it to be real)}}

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw.
A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation.
Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast.
The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.
Typical suggestions include &quot;Close the book and leave&quot;, &quot;Forget the existence of the book&quot;, and so forth.
If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear.
The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.

saving throw.

The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms.
The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere.
You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired.

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it.
A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward.
When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle.
The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries.
If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.
A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap.
If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends.
The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can.
If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day.
If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.
A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.
You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.
If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does.
The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can.
The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure.
Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check.
The DM makes this check secretly.
If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective.
You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.
This task also takes 10 full minutes.
If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell.
The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level.
A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.
If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5.
The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&#8212;even a straw laid across it.
However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.
This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa}}

Each round on your turn, a phantasmal strangler deals 2d6 points of damage to the subject.

It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle.

It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level.
A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.
Thus, a mount created by a 12th-level caster has the 8th, 10th, and 12th caster level abilities.
8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.
10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).
12th Level: The mount can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.
14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).

The cylinders of shadow (called &quot;glooms&quot;) occupy space as Medium creatures (a 5-foot square), are 10 feet tall, and cannot leave the area of the spell.
A creature fully engulfed by one or more of these glooms has concealment. This concealment applies to attacks made against or by creatures in these glooms.
The glooms are under your limited control. While the spell is in effect, you can use a free action on your turn to direct a controlled gloom to attach itself to and envelop a particular target and follow it. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid being enveloped. Success indicates the gloom dissipates; failure means the target is surrounded by magical darkness. Once it is attached to a target, a gloom stays with that target until the spell's duration expires.

The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long.
When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.
Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it.
The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike.
If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise.
If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed.
While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells.
It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings.
It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury.
However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.
The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical.
A dispel magic can remove the sigil.
An erase spell destroys the entire page of text.
Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells
that hide or garble text, such as secret page.
Material Component: 500 gp worth of powdered amber, a scale from any snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores}}

You can reach into the Plane of Shadow through the portal created by shadow cache, but only small, nonliving objects can pass entirely through the hole. The cache can hold up to 30 cubic feet of material, or 250 pounds.
You can recover objects placed in the portal throughout the duration of the spell, or by casting another hadow cache later. A shadow cache remains stationary at the point where you create it. Items placed in a shadow cache can possibly be picked up by natives of the Plane of Shadow, and in any event are slowly moved by the morphic trait of the plane.

The animated shadow tentacle extends 5 feet per level of the caster (up to 50 feet) from its anchoring point.
The caster directs the shadow tendril, indicating a target for it to attack.
The tentacle makes a melee touch attack using the caster's attack bonus.
The tentacle does not inflict damage, but can be used to entangle an opponent.
A successful melee touch attack means that the tentacle has entangled its victim.
The shadow tentacle is anchored, so it can hold its victim motionless if the caster desires; otherwise, the entangled victim can move at half speed up to the length of the animated tentacle.
The shadow tentacle has 20 hit points, AC 15, and can be burst with a Strength check (DC 23).
A character can also free himself from the tentacle with an Escape Artist check (DC 20).
Changing targets is a standard action.
When the caster changes targets, the tentacle releases its current victim and immediately attacks the new target.

A knock spell doesn't negate or automatically bypass a sign of sealing, but will suppress the sign for 10 minutes on a successful caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the sign's creator). A sign of sealing is a magic trap that can be disarmed with a DC 28 Disable Device check. You can pass your own sign safely, and it remains set behind you.

For example, you could cast this spell, then cast detect thoughts, and this spell maintains the concentration on detect thoughts while you cast discern lies and maintain concentration on that spell yourself.

Once they become solid, the three weapons shoot forward at your targets.
This spell allows you to split a target weapon of up to Large size (such as a greatsword, shortspear, and so on) into three exact duplicates.
These duplicates immediately launch themselves at a target or targets of your choice within close range.
You can direct one or more of the weapons at the same target or split them up among three different targets.
Make a ranged attack roll for each weapon (using your ranged attack bonus or the ranged attack bonus of a fighter of your caster level, whichever is higher) as if you were proficient with the weapon in the normal manner.
(For example, if used on a greatsword, you would make a ranged attack roll as if you were proficient with the greatsword, without the normal penalty for using an improvised throwing weapon).
The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if it does not have an enhancement bonus already.
Each duplicate that hits deals damage as if you had struck the target with the weapon in melee (including any special effects such as bane, smite evil, critical hits, sneak attack.
Weapon Focus, and so on).
Your Strength bonus does not apply, since the force of the weapon comes from the spell, not your own Strength.
A duplicate does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.
Casting the spell destroys the targeted weapon to create the duplicates, and the duplicates are destroyed whether or not they hit.
Because of this, the spell is rarely used on magic weapons.
It cannot be cast on artifacts, natural weapons, weapons animated with animate objects or similar spells, or weaponlike magical creations (such as Mordenkainen's sword).
Origin: This spell was created by Delgarth of Sumbarin, a long-forgotten minor realm along the banks of the River Dessarin.
Delgarth was a powerful barbarian who concealed his limited prowess as a sorcerer so he could use it as an unexpected advantage during the frequent assassination attempts launched by his estranged kinfolk}}

A fiendish viper summoned by this spell has resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance 7; and a smite good attack that provides a +2 bonus on one damage roll.
Starting in the round you complete the spell, you can spit three vipers as a standard action or one viper as a move action. (Thus, if you move and then cast this spell, you cannot spit any vipers until your next turn, but if you cast this spell without moving, you can spit forth one viper as your move action in that round.) Spat vipers land at your feet in an adjacent square of your choice and act on the same round, on your turn, just as creatures summoned by a **summon monster** spell do.
The snakes are not actually present in your mouth, and they do not interfere with your breathing. However, until you have brought forth all the snakes summoned by the spell, you cannot speak, cast spells with verbal components, or activate items that require speech.

A wall of ectoplasm cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures.
Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created.
The ectoplasm is semisolid (not raw)&#8212;about the consistency of packed snow&#8212;and retains its shape rather than collapsing into a formless mass.
Because ectoplasm is a ghost touch material, it is an impenetrable barrier to incorporeal creatures (although they may attack the wall or go around it).
The ectoplasm is opaque and blocks line of effect.
Ectoplasm Plane: A sheet of ectoplasm appears.
The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level and covers up to a 10-foot-square per caster level (so a 6th-level wizard could create a wall of ectoplasm 30 feet long and 20 feet high, a wall 60 feet long and 10 feet high, and so on).
The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored.
A vertical wall need be anchored only on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like.
Each 10-foot square of wall has hardness 0 and 2 hit points per inch of thickness.
Creatures can hit the wall without making an attack roll.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
A creature can break through the wall with a Strength check (DC 12 + caster level).
Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet +1 foot per caster level.
Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius.
It is as hard to break through as the ectoplasm plane variation.
You can create the hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though these creatures get a Reflex saving throw to avoid being trapped.
Material Component: A cube of resin and a drop of oil}}

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object, but it can be adjacent to such.
It must always be a flat plane, although you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
The wall of incarnum must be anchored to a surface, but this can be a floor, a ceiling, or even a wall.
The wall of incarnum can't be moved once it is created.
A wall of incarnum is 1 inch thick.
It can be dispelled, but it cannot be damaged or broken, and spells cannot pass through it.
Ethereal creatures can pass through it, but any other creature (including the caster) attempting to pass through a wall must succeed on aWill save or be blocked by the barrier.
Regardless of the save's result, the wall of incarnum deals 1d4 points of essentia damage (or Wisdom damage if the creature has no essentia) to the creature.
Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in the wall of
incarnum increases the damage dealt on a failed Will save by 1 point.

A wall of light has no physical substance and does not otherwise hinder attacks, movement, or spells passing through it, although it blocks line of sight for other creatures.
A creature that passes through a wall of light becomes dazzled for the duration of the spell. Spell resistance applies when passing through the wall. Sightless creatures and those already dazzled are not affected by passing through a wall of light.
A wall of light sheds light equivalent to a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/daylight--2601/">**daylight**</a> spell. Wall of light counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level.

By casting wand modulation on the target wand you hold, you temporarily alter it to cast a different spell.
After casting this spell, the next spell you cast upon the target wand affects the remaining charges, allowing the wand to discharge that spell instead of the one it was created to cast.
The spell cast after wand modulation must be of a lower level than the spell the wand normally casts.
Replacement spells cast from the affected wand are cast at the minimum caster level.
Each use of an affected wand now expends 2 charges from the wand instead of the usual single charge.
If the wand holds insufficient charges to invoke the new spell, it cannot be activated.
You can't use wand modulation to change a wand's spell to one with a costly material component or focus or with an
XP component, even if the original spell has a similar component or focus.
For example, a 5th-level wizard facing an angry fire elemental wishes to cast magic missile (a 1st-level spell) from his wand of scorching ray (a 2nd-level spell), which happens to have a caster level of 5th.
He casts wand modulation and in the following round casts magic missile.
The wand can now cast magic missile as a 1st-level caster (the minimum caster level), but each use expends 2 charges.
The wizard can now use the wand to cast magic missile for 5 minutes, after which it reverts back to a normal wand of scorching ray}}

You cause a weapon to gain the ability to deal energy damage in addition to its other abilities, similar to how a flaming burst weapon deals extra fire damage on a hit or a critical hit. The weapon can deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, chosen by you at the time of casting. The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of that energy type on a successful hit. On a critical hit, the weapon deals an additional 1d10 points of energy damage.

This spell can be cast on a weapon that already deals energy damage, and if the weapon already creates the same type of damage as the spell, the effects stack.

This spell fuels the Dracorage for a short period.
It causes the target to instantly and fully succumb to the Dracorage, shifting the target's attitude toward nondragons to hostile and instilling in the dragon a bloodthirsty desire to murder and wreak havoc.
This usually causes the dragon (even a good metallic dragon) to immediately attack all nondragons nearby.
Because aggravate Dracorage manipulates the existing Dracorage mythal, the Will save against the spell is 4 higher than normal and has a DC of 18 + the appropriate ability modifier.
(Nevertheless, many casters of the spell will use subterfuge to trick the target dragon into allowing the spell to be cast freely upon it, thereby avoiding the dragon's high Will save bonus).

Aggravate Dracorage functions only during the period of the Dracorage and has no effect on dragons at other times.
This spell counters or dispels abate Dracorage.

(A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).
Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of **animate dead**.  (The <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/desecrate--2604/">deserate</a> spell doubles this limit; see page 218).
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled.  (You choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
**Skeletons:** A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons.
**Zombies:** A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie. The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies}}

You curse one creature to a frustrating existence on the edge of the Ethereal Plane.

Because the magic of the spell only causes the subject to blink when attacking or casting, attackers have no miss chance against her, and spells cast against her affect her normally.
Because the blinking is so rapid, she cannot attempt to blink through walls or move in the Ethereal Plane.
The subject of a baleful blink spell can cast spells on itself with impunity; in this case, it has no miss chance because the target of its spell (itself) travels along with the spell.
The subject can also target creatures on the Ethereal Plane, but still has a 50% chance of failure on attacks and spells.
Spells with the force descriptor are unaffected by the effect of baleful blink}}

You can either send the claw to attack one specific target or order it to guard an area.

The claw has Strength 22, Dexterity 18, AC 16 (+4 Dex, +2 for invisibility), and hit points equal to one-half your full normal total.
It attacks at your base attack bonus, applying modifiers for its own statistics as appropriate (+6 for Str and +2 for invisibility).
It can make multiple attacks per round with a full attack action if your base attack bonus is high enough to allow it.
Since it counts as an invisible attacker, the target loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to AC unless it has uncanny dodge.
A Caligarde's claw deals 1d6+6 points of damage with each successful attack.
The claw is corporeal and can be destroyed, which ends the spell.
Since it is invisible, any attacks made against it have a 50% miss chance.
If ordered to attack a single target, the claw moves from its current position toward the designated target at a speed of 90 feet, provided the target is within range of the sp ell.
It attacks on your turn and continues to attack until it or its target is destroyed, or the spell's duration ends, or you redirect it to a new target or to guard duty.
While it is assigned to attack a specific target, the claw cannot make attacks of opportunity.
If you order the claw to guard an area, it flies at a speed of 90 feet to any 5-foot square you designate within the spell's range and waits there.
While on guard duty, it does not attack on its own, but it makes attacks of opportunity whenever a foe performs an action that provokes such an attack within 5 feet of its position.
The claw functions as though it had the Combat Reflexes feat for this purpose, so it may make a total of five attacks of opportunity per round.
A claw in guard mode cannot take attack actions or full attack actions; it can only wait for an action that provokes an attack of opportunity}}

A double of you appears nearby.
You create a fetch, a perfect replica of your form at the time you cast this spell.
Little more than an animated reproduction, a fetch is mindless but capable of performing simple tasks or imitating you.
The creation is the same size as you and occupies space just as a living creature does.
You have a mental connection with your fetch and can give it new orders as a standard action.
The fetch duplicates your form in every way but texture.
You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is; this result is opposed by observers' Spot checks as normal.
Anyone touching the fetch finds it rubbery and soft, and in so doing immediately realizes its magical nature.
The fetch's body includes useless versions of all the equipment you possess: A weapon wielded by the fetch is too flimsy to deal damage, and tools it carries are fragile and imprecise.
Items created with a fetch are part of its form and dissipate if separated from it.
At your order, the fetch can retrieve things for you, open unstuck doors, hold chairs, and the like, as well as perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending.
The fetch can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a skill that can't be used untrained.
It can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity tirelessly if ordered to do so as long as you remain within the spell's range.
You can have the fetch imitate you, such as by sitting at a desk and pretending to write, lying in bed and breathing deeply, or skulking with a weapon drawn.
It can even imitate tasks it can't actually perform, though it automatically fails any attempt at such performance&#8212;for instance, even though a fetch can pretend to decipher an ancient text, it can't actually do it.
The fetch weighs roughly the same as you do, so it can trigger any traps you would if you were to pass through the same space, setting off tripwires, pressure plates, some magical forms of detection, and similar devices.
Its land speed is normal for a creature of your kind (for example, 30 feet for a human or 20 feet for a halfling).
Even if you normally have other modes of movement available (such as a fly or swim speed), the fetch can't use those.
The fetch automatically fails any saving throw required of it.
If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.
The fetch has an effective Strength score of 6, so it can lift 60 pounds or drag 300 pounds.
Its Dexterity is 10, so it has an AC of 10 (plus size modifier).
It gains no AC benefit from any equipment or effect on you when the spell is cast (such as armor you wear, since the armor created for it is part of its form), though it can then wear real armor or other items to increase its Armor Class.
It has no Constitution score and 10 hit points; if reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
It can't be healed, nor can it benefit from temporary hit points.
The fetch has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score.
You can command it to make noise, but it can't communicate in any way, nor can it understand instructions other than the simple orders you give it telepathically.
The fetch cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll.
Even if armed, it doesn't threaten an area around it and thus can't flank an enemy, nor can it use the aid another action to improve your Armor Class or attack rolls.
The fetch has the same alignment aura as you do.

This spell places a curse on the targets, making them more susceptible to your magical attacks.
When you cast this spell, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire; any creature affected by the spell takes an extra 1d6 points of damage from any of your spells that deal damage of that energy type.
The extra damage isn't added to other effects, such as a weapon's flaming special ability, nor does it apply to damage dealt by other characters.
As part of the casting of this spell, you can sacrifice one additional sorcerer spell slot of up to 9th level; doing this increases the extra damage from the spell by 1 point per level of the sacrificed slot.
For example, if you spend a 4th-level spell slot to cast curse of the elemental lords and a 6th-level spell slot to augment it, the resulting curse adds 1d6+6 points of damage to the damage taken by targets of your spells of the chosen energy type.
Curse of the elemental lords can't be dispelled, but it can be removed by any effect that would remove a curse.
Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), the extra damage from this spell also applies to your breath weapon (assuming that it deals the appropriate type of damage)}}

You can cast any spell you like at the subject, even area spells, effect spells, and spells for whom the subject would ordinarily not be a legitimate target.
The spells don't do anything other than provide the subject with power points, but you must still cast them normally, obeying the component and range requirements listed in the description of each spell.
For each spell you cast into the dweomer of transference, the psionic creature gets temporary power points, according to the following table.
The transference isn't perfectly efficient; for instance, if you cast a 7th-level spell at a psionic creature, it receives insufficient psionic power points to manifest a 7th-level power.

You create a circle of five colored spheres that orbit your head at a distance of 1 foot. These spheres provide as much light as a torch and can be used offensively or defensively. Each sphere corresponds to one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic).
If used to attack, on your turn as a standard action you can direct one or more spheres to strike a creature or creatures in range, no two of which are more than 30 feet apart. Each sphere deals 5 points of energy damage per five caster levels (maximum 20 points of damage) to a single creature, so an 11th-level caster's sphere deals 10 points of energy damage. The subject can make a Reflex save for half damage against each sphere.
If you are attacked with an effect that causes energy damage, and the sphere of that type of energy is still present, you can have that sphere absorb some of that energy damage. Each sphere grants you energy resistance 5 per five caster levels. If a sphere is used to absorb damage, that sphere is destroyed.
When used to attack a creature with spell resistance, make one spell resistance roll for all spheres that attack the target in a round. Success or failure applies to all spheres striking the creature that round.

A fang trap functions like a glyph of warding, except that it can't be made to activate on the basis of faith or alignment, and you can't be caught in your own fang trap.
A fang trap is usually cast on a specific spot, such as a doorway or an area of floor.
It can be set to distinguish between humans and Scaled Ones, or between beings wearing particular items and those who are not.
The trigger can't be a symbol, but it may be one or more specific items (for example, &quot;six metal rings on digits, no more and no less&quot;).
When a fang trap discharges, the subject is held immobile for 1 round.
A successful Fortitude saving throw frees the subject after that period without further effect.
A failed save means the subject takes 1d4 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage per caster level from the bite of a pair of unseen jaws.

The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).
Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15).
This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks).
If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.
Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet).
The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)&#8212;blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed.
The special powers of each version are as follows.
Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch.
You take only half damage from cold-based attacks.
If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch.
You take only half damage from fire-based attacks.

You gain the ability to step into fires and move from one fire to another. The fires you enter and move between must be at least as big around as you are. Fire elementals and other fire creatures are not considered &quot;fires&quot; for the purpose of this spell, nor are sources of great heat, such as pools of lava.
Once in a fire, you can instantly know the locations of all suitable fires within long range (400 ft. + 40 ft/level) and can transport yourself to one of them. Each transport counts as a full-round action. With each casting of the spell, you can transport yourself once per caster level. If a fire's location doesn't offer enough space for you (for example, a fire contained inside a furnace too small to hold you or a fire already occupied by a big cauldron), it is not a viable destination and you don't sense its location. If a fire rests on a surface that can't support you, it is still a viable destination and you suffer the appropriate consequences if you transport yourself to it. For example, if you transport yourself into a fire burning in a pit full of oil, you fall into the oil when you arrive there.
**Fire stride** provides no protection against fire, so it is advisable to obtain such protection before using the spell}}

A fire trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth).
When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center.
When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center.
The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.
A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap.
An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.
Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast.
Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.
Note:Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a fire trap and Disable Device to thwart it.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.
If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions (such as &quot;Wait here&quot; or &quot;Defend this area against attack&quot;), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level.
A clever recipient can subvert some instructions: For example, if you order the recipient to protect you from all harm, it might place you in a nice, safe dungeon for the duration of the spell.
If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores.

No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect.
The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas.
A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish.

Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.
For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a mirror image created by a caster outside the globe.
If that caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to reappear when the caster exited the globe.
Likewise, a caster standing in the area of a light spell would still receive sufficient illumination for vision, even though that part of the light spell's area that lies within the globe would not be luminous.

Creatures caught within the ice web become entangled in the strands.
Attacking a creature in an ice web won't cause you to become entangled.
Any creature moving into or through the spell's area takes 1d6 points of frostburn damage per round.
In addition, anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save.
If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal (see below).
If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check.
Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the ice web very slowly.
Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check.
The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
If you have at least 5 feet of ice web between you and an opponent, it provides cover.
If you have at least 20 feet of ice web between you, it provides total cover.
The strands of an ice web are immune to damage from cold.
Any fire&#8212;a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth&#8212;can melt 5 square feet of coldfire strands in 1 round.
Ice web can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent ice web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.
Creatures with the cold subtype may pass unimpeded and unharmed through an ice web.

You learn any special qualities, vulnerabilities, and resistances the target creature has. Vulnerabilities include anything that causes the creature more than the normal amount of damage (such as a creature with the cold subtype having vulnerability to fire or a crystalline creature's susceptibility to the shatter spell). Resistances include any effects that reduce or negate damage the creature takes and immunities to particular attacks. The spell identifies resistances and vulnerabilities granted by spell effects.
For example, if cast upon a balor, you learn that it has damage reduction 15/cold iron and good; spell resistance 28; immunity to poison, fire, and electricity; resistance to acid 10 and cold 10; and that it does not have any particular vulnerabilities}}

In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities).
Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants.
The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise&#8212;it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition.
The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone.
It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).
The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue.
In addition, these three areas are protected by an <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/alarm--2299/">**alarm**</a> spell.
Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.
The secure shelter contains rude furnishings&#8212;eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.
Material Component: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood.
These must be augmented by the components of the unseen servant spell (string and a bit of wood) if this benefit is to be included}}

They respond to your thoughts alone, and they can pull the carriage at a speed of up to 50 feet.
The carriage resists flames as if it were stone.
It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).

You speak the words and feel the power of the plane buckle within your mind, then relax as you impress order upon the chaos.**
This spell grants temporary control over the terrain of Limbo. Normally, unless controlled, the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 158) is just what the plane's name implies: a roiling soup of energy and elements. Natives learn to control it or to inhabit areas that have enjoyed some measure of control for a long period, but visitors to areas of &quot;raw&quot; limbo must make a DC 16 Wisdom check to gain control over the dangerous roil.
The perinarch spell gives you automatic control of a radius of raw Limbo (an area not already stabilized or within some other creature's control) in close range. Control allows you to reshape the raw limbo as you desire, adding or subtracting one of the four basic elements once per round as a standard action. A favorite among travelers from the Material Plane is a chunk of earth surrounded by a small atmosphere of air.
The effect of this spell overlaps with the control already (potentially) established with a Wisdom check. Your allies can give their control over to you concurrently with the spell being cast, if they so choose. Control cannot be wrested away from you while the spell is in effect (which is one of the best reasons to cast this spell, even if you have a high Wisdom). If you move more than 100 feet away from the area that you controlled, the order you imposed fades away.
You are unable to achieve any works of complexity within an area you control, but you can mix two or three elements in a crude fashion; a few examples are provided below. You can attempt to seize control of a new area that already contains foes; however, foes can make a Reflex save to get out of the area.
<strong>Thick Barrier:</strong> You can &quot;thicken&quot; empty air with dust and rock, creating a zone around yourself and your allies that outside creatures must hack or force a way through. Their speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures.
<strong>Fiery Barrier:</strong> You can create a thick field of flame that deals 3d10 points of fire damage to any creature attempting to pass through it. The field also deals 3d10 points of fire damage for each round a creature lingers within it.
<strong>Complete Barrier:</strong> You can create a complete barrier of solid stone up to 1 foot thick encircling yourself and your allies, preventing access by any other than the most accomplished tunnelers. On the other hand, you can attempt to trap foes within their own bubble of solid stone}}

All creatures within the area of the spell that fail their saving throws cannot make attacks of opportunity.
In addition, all creatures within the area are considered flanked.
A creature ignores these effects when it leaves the spell's area.
If a creature reenters the spell's area after leaving it, the creature can attempt another save to resist the spell if its initial save failed.
A creature that enters the area for the first time after the spell is cast must also make a saving throw to resist the effect.
A phantom battle spell produces noise appropriate to a mob of creatures locked in battle.
Anyone in the battle can plainly see that the conjured fighters are no threat, since they strike solely at other phantom warriors, but the din, tumult, and confusion make it difficult to focus on the true foes at hand.

The new form may be of the same type as the subject or any of the following types: aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin. The assumed form can't have more Hit Dice than your caster level (or the subject's HD, whichever is lower), to a maximum of 15 HD at 15th level. You can't cause a subject to assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you cause a subject to assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. The subject's creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form (see the Monster Manual for more information).
Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal the subject further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains dead.
The subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict, improved grab, and poison) but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such as blindsense, fast healing, regeneration, and scent) or any supernatural or spell-like abilities.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action.

The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the subject's normal form, and can have no more Hit Dice than you have, or that the subject has (whichever is greater), and in any case the assumed form cannot have more than 15 Hit Dice.
You cannot change subjects into constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead unless they already are one of these types.
Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting for a day; and changing back does not heal the creature further).
If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form, though it remains dead.
The polymorphed creature acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into while retaining its own mind.
Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.
Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, swoop and rake, and constriction; but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, energy effects, etc.), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, etc.).
A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not magical flight and other magical forms of travel, such as blink, dimension door, phase door, plane shift,
teleport, and teleport without error.
Extremely high speeds for certain creatures are the result of extraordinary or magical ability, so they are not granted by this spell.
(In general, these abilities include nonflying speeds greater than 60 feet and flying speeds greater than 120 feet).
Other nonmagical abilities (such as an owl's low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained.
Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form.
The creature's new scores and faculties are average ones for the race or species into which it has been transformed.
You cannot, for example, turn someone into a mighty weight lifter to give the subject great Strength.
Likewise, you cannot change the subject into a bigger or more powerful version of a creature (or a smaller, weaker version).
Nor can you turn the subject into a variant form of the creature.
For example, you can turn the subject into an ogre, but not a half-dragon ogre.
The subject retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses.
(New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses).
The subject retains its own type (for example, &quot;humanoid&quot;), extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities.
The subject does not gain the supernatural abilities (such as breath weapons and gaze attacks) or the extraordinary abilities of the new creature.
The subject can cast spells for which it has components.
It needs a humanlike voice for verbal components and humanlike hands for somatic components.
The subject does not gain the spell-like abilities of its new form.
When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form.
If the new form is a creature that does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.
Material components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast spells.
If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the subject's equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties.
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type.
The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species.
The subject can be changed into a member of its own species or even into itself.
The subject is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
Incorporeal or gaseous forms cannot be assumed, and incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed.
A natural shapeshifter (a lycanthrope, doppelganger, experienced druid, etc.).
can take its natural form as a standard action}}

The subject of this spell gains magical buoyancy and floats on the surface of the water for the duration of the spell, despite its weight or normal buoyancy. It cannot swim below the surface of the water. Creatures that must breathe water can still do so. If the subject is underwater at the time this spell is cast, it rises toward the surface at a speed of 150 feet. The magic of the spell prevents the subject from taking damage from the speed of the ascent.
This spell is particularly effective at raising sunken ships from the deep. If you know the exact details of the shipwreck (its appearance, its name, the date of its creation, its history, and the circumstances of its sinking), the vertical distance between you and the subject is not a factor. When cast to raise a shipwreck, the spell brings up all surviving fragments of the ship, along with any loose objects that are in contact with the ship or enclosed inside it. The ship and its fragments remain on the surface of the ocean until the spell's duration ends, at which point the ship sinks again if it has not been repaired.

You feel a lightness in your limbs, and a surge of protective energy as the cloud shrieks and wheels around you.**
When you cast this spell, a mass of avian shadows sur­rounds you, protecting you from attacks even as it grants you buoyant dexterity. The swirling shadows grant you concealment and soft cover (+4 to AC, but you gain no bonus on Reflex saves and cannot use your cover to make Hide checks). Furthermore, any creatures attempting melee attacks against you take 1d8 points of slashing damage from the raptor cloud. Creatures get no save against this damage, but spell resistance (if any) applies.
Creatures wielding reach weapons can attack you without taking damage, but creatures that have natural reach take damage as above.
Though a raptor cloud moves with you, you cannot deal damage with it by pushing it against creatures or objects. Only creatures that make melee attacks against you are subject to the cloud's defensive damage. However, you can elect to expend the spell's energy at any point by tar­geting the raptor cloud against a single adjacent creature or object as a standard action. This attack deals 6d8 points of damage (Reflex half) and ends the spell.
A raptor cloud gives you a certain amount of lift as it swirls around you, granting you a +5 bonus on Jump and Tumble checks as you roll and weave through melee.

Should the subject die before the spell expires, however, it rises as a zombie 1 round later (as per the animate dead spell), as long as a sufficient corpse remains.
Any undead created in this manner are automatically under your control.
At any given time, you can have a number of HD worth of undead animated through seed of undeath equal to your own HD, and they count against the maximum number of HD worth of undead you can control at any time (as described under animate dead).
Material Component: A black onyx gem worth 25 gp per HD of the subject}}

In addition, it blocks finely tuned senses of touch such as those that provide a creature with tremorsense.

Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.
Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.
Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.
Spells that deal damage, such as Melf's acid arrow, have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save.
Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack.
If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur.
Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.
In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not.
Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mist, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.
Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.
A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy).
It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses.
Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work.
(Roll for each use and each affected character separately).
Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11).
A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.
Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell}}

You cause the target's shadow to become a temporary gateway to a pocket realm within the Plane of Shadow. The target must make a Will save or be pulled into the gateway. Inside the pocket realm, the creature sees a deserted, gloomy duplicate of the real world, while shadowy phantasms stalk and taunt it without causing actual harm. Each round, the creature can attempt another Will save to return from the shadow well. Otherwise, the subject returns to the real world when the spell's duration expires.
Being trapped in a shadow well can be terrifying; upon returning to the real world, the subject must succeed on another Will save or be frightened for 1d4 rounds.
Upon leaving the pocket realm, the subject reappears in the spot it had been in when the shadow well spell was cast. If this spot is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest adjacent empty space.
Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a shadow well spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to flee to another plane as normal. The target might still become frightened upon leaving}}

A target who fails a saving throw against this spell moves immediately toward the nearest stretch of ocean that it can find and attempts to completely submerse itself in the water.
This flight will be by the safest means possible, withdrawing from combat, fighting defensively, and not passing through threatened areas.
The target will only fight if someone actively attempts to prevent it from following through with its search for the ocean; if this fight is with an ally, the target is granted a second saving throw to throw off the effects of the spell.
In some environments, this means that those affected simply flee in the direction of the nearest coast.
Along a shoreline, targets often plunge into the surf.
Aboard ship, they leap overboard.

The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like).
A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
A creature can't take a 5-foot step while in solid fog.

In the round when you cast the spell, the stone sphere appears at the spot you designate within the spell's range, and you can direct its movement as a free action. In subsequent rounds, you must actively direct the stone sphere in order to move it; otherwise, it remains motionless. Directing the movement of a stone sphere in any round after its initial appearance requires a move action.
If you move a stone sphere into a square occupied by an enemy, it stops moving and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to every creature in that square. A successful Reflex save negates the damage.
Material Component: A smooth sphere of marble 1 inch in diameter}}

The blade immediately attacks your enemy.**
You cause a blade of pale green force to appear and strike the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. Though it makes regular melee attacks, the sword strikes as a spell, not a weapon (and so can strike incorporeal creatures). A sword of deception always strikes from your direction, and so it can't be used to flank with your attacks, but it could flank with your allies.
The blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. In addition, each successful hit provides a -2 penalty on the target's next saving throw roll (-4 on a successful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of -5 on a single creature) and lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the benefit of a remove curse spell.
Each round, a sword of deception continues to attack the previous round's target unless you use a standard action to switch it to a new target within range. In any round when the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack as a standard action (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). The weapon can make multiple attack rolls against a single target with a full attack action if its base attack bonus permits. A sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as any other spell).
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check the first time the sword attacks. If the check is successful, the sword can attack that creature with normal effect for the duration of the spell. If not, the sword of deception is dispelled. If the target goes beyond the spell range or out of your sight, the sword of deception returns to you and hovers}}

You can wield a thunderlance in one or two hands, dealing a base 3d6 points of damage (crit 20/×3). Instead of using your Strength modifier, you use the higher of your Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.
If you successfully strike a target protected by any force effect of 3rd level or lower, such as a shield or mage armor spell, the thunderlance might dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Make a dispel check against the level of the caster who created the effect. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled. The thunderlance remains whether you succeed or fail on this check.

Each sphere corresponds to one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic).
On your turn you can direct one or more spheres to strike a creature or creatures in range, no two of which may be more than 30 feet apart.
Each sphere inflicts 1d4 points of energy damage per four caster levels (max 4d4 each) to a single creature, so an 8th-level caster's sphere inflicts 2d4 points of energy damage.
The target may make a Reflex save for half damage against each sphere.
If you are attacked with an effect that causes energy damage, and the sphere of that type of energy is still present, you can have that sphere absorb some of that energy damage, destroying the sphere.
The sphere absorbs damage that round equal to the amount of damage it would deal if used to attack, so an 8th-level caster's fire sphere absorbs 2d4 points of fire damage.

If the subject fails its initial saving throw, it takes another 3 points of drain to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores each day thereafter as long as the spell lasts.
A successful Fortitude save negates this drain, but doesn't end the spell's duration.
The ability drain from this spell can be eliminated as normal, but doing this doesn't end the spell's duration.
If you cast this spell on a creature while another casting of touch of years is already in effect on it, the second spell doesn't deal ability drain.

These conditions can be removed by normal means (such as remove blindness/deafness), but doing this has no effect on the ability drain.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures.
Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created.
Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed.
A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.
Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).
Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears.
The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level.
It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet).
The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored.
A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like.
Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.
Creatures can hit the wall automatically.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains.
Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).
Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level.
Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius.

The wall can seal off a passage or breach, or be used to construct new walls.
A wall of salt is 1 inch thick per caster level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
You can form a wall of salt into nearly any shape desired.
The wall need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp.
If such a span is more than 20 feet long, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell's area by half.
For example, a 10th-level caster could create a salt span with a surface area of five 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth, by likewise reducing the area.
The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell or by chipping and breaking.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 3 hit points per inch and hardness 2.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 1 per inch of thickness.
Directing a constant blast of water at a wall of salt (for example, a geyser from a decanter of endless water) dissolves the mineral, dealing 10 points of damage per minute (which hardness does not reduce).
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of salt, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

This spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand. The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.
Creatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level).
Creatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located.
Any open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished.

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
You can create a wall of scales in almost any shape you desire, provided it is anchored in some fashion.
It need not be vertical, and you can shape it into a circular or dome-shaped enclosure about yourself or another creature.
The wall can be destroyed by normal means of dealing damage, as well as by disintegrate spells and so forth.
It is immune to acid and fire.
In addition, the wall of scales has damage reduction 5/magic.
For every five caster levels above 5th, this damage reduction increases by 5, reaching a maximum of 20/magic at 20th level.

This spell creates a 10-foot-thick wall of fresh water or seawater (as selected by you). The water forms around objects and creatures in its area, plunging these creatures and objects underwater. A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature's next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall.
Creatures can move through a wall of water by making Swim checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall.
Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location. Water brought out of the wall in a container instantly evaporates as the wall itself forms more water to replace what was removed.

In addition, while this spell is in effect, you add your caster level as an insight bonus on any one Reflex save.

This alteration changes each animal's size category to the next largest (from Large to Huge, for example), grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2-2 in the **Dungeon Master's Guide**.  The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change.
The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.
<strong>Special: When casting **animal growth** as a Scalykind Domain spell, only ophidian and reptilian creatures are affected.</strong>
If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.  If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it&#8212;the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.
The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting}}

The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features.
All items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form.
If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.
If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save. If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form,  and its Hit Dice and hit points change to match an average creature of its new form. These abilities and  statistics return to normal if the effect is later ended.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the spell's effect)}}

An attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures takes no penalty.

Individually targeted spells have a 50% chance to fail against you while blinking, unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures.

You take only half damage from area attacks (or full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
While blinking, you strike as an invisible creature (+2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.
You take only half damage from falling, since you are subject to gravity only while you are on the Material Plane.
You can ready an action to blink away from a specific enemy attack, physical or magical.
If you do so, the attack misses automatically unless it can also affect ethereal targets.
You move at three-quarters speed, since movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.

You do not risk materializing inside a solid object unless you actually end your move inside one, in which case you materialize and are shunted off to the nearest open space.
You take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet traveled in his manner.
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.
You interact with ethereal creatures in roughly the same way you interact with material ones (their attacks have a 50% miss chance against you, and so on)}}

A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the gust's effects.
Those that fail the save are pushed away from the caster a distance of 3 feet per caster level.

A boreal wind can do anything a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do.
It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, overturn tents
and blow down small huts, scuttle a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of the range.
The wind can change direction if you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely blows in the same direction}}

Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone.
For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.
For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it.
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.
For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user.
Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item&#8212;

Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.
Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying hives of giant ants, for example.

Its effects last until the darkenbeast is slain or until exposure to sunlight (see above) dispels the transmutation.
The transmutation can also be dispelled by a dispel magic spell, although such an attempt would have to overcome the darkenbeast's spell resistance.
A sunbeam spell automatically dispels the transmutation without needing to overcome spell resistance.
If you are going to imprint another spell on the darkenbeast, you must cast that spell immediately after the create darkenbeast spell is over and pass a Spellcraft check (DC 12 + level of the spell being imprinted).
The imprinted spell has no effect; it merely goes &quot;into&quot; the darkenbeast.
Another spellcaster using detect magic for 1 round can determine whether a darkenbeast has a spell imprinted.
After 3 rounds, detect magic and a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15+ level of imprinted spell) can identify what spell a darkenbeast has imprinted on it.
A created darkenbeast is under the caster's direct telepathic command.
There is no limit to the number of darkenbeasts a sorcerer or wizard can command, but a spellcaster can only have a number of darkenbeasts with imprinted spells equal to her caster level.

Airborne creatures are treated as if they were one size category smaller for the purpose of resisting the bull rush.

A dancing blade attacks using the initiative modifier and base attack bonus of the creature it fights for, though it gains no other attack or damage modifiers the creature might have (including those from Strength) and takes a -4 penalty on its attack rolls if the creature it fights for doesn't have proficiency with a weapon of its kind.
The sword moves with the creature it fights for (and so can take the full attack action if that creature does), staying within 5 feet at all times and dropping to the ground if that creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.

However, dispel water cannot counter an instantaneous spell or effect.
You choose to use dispel water in one of three ways: to dry up a body of water, to counter a water-based spell or effect, or to dismiss an extraplanar creature of the water subtype.
Dry Up Water: This effect instantly destroys 200 cubic feet of water per level.
Remaining water rushes in to fill the void.
Cast in a large body of water, such as an ocean, the destruction of 1,000 or more cubic feet of water produces a strong current that pulls boats and creatures down.
Creatures caught in the current must make a DC 20 Swim check to avoid going under.
A creature that fails the Swim check is pulled down to a depth of 10 feet per caster level and must hold its breath or begin to drown (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
The current might capsize vessels: The chance is 95% for a craft shorter than 20 feet long, 50% for one from 20 to 60 feet long, and 20% for one over 60 feet long.
Counterspell:Used in this way, dispel water targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (see page 170 of the Player's Handbook).
It only counters spells and spell-like abilities that have the water descriptor, or appear on the Water domain spell list, or clearly involve water (such as create food and water, sleet storm, and wall of ice).
To successfully counter the other spell, you must make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level.

For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as <a href="/spells/spell-compendium--86/dragon-breath--3967/">**dragon breath**</a> (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, your breath weapon acts as a targeted <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dispel-magic--2315/">**dispel magic**</a> (**PH** 223).
For each creature or object that fails its saving throw against your breath weapon and that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the highest level spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell or until you fail all your checks. A creature's magic items are not affected, and creatures and objects that rolled successful saving throws against your breath weapon are likewise not affected.
If a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-i--2441/">**monster summoning**</a>), is in the area and fails its saving throw against your breath weapon, you can also make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature (returning it whence it came).
For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the area of your breath weapon, you make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
Spells are dispelled prior to the effect of your breath weapon being resolved.
You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell in the area that you have cast}}

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.
If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).
Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81).
Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.
You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it}}

This spell calls a dragon. You can ask the dragon to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the dragon to bargain for its services.
The summoned dragon requires payment for its services, which takes the form of coins, gems, or other precious objects the dragon can add to its hoard. This payment must be made before the dragon agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.
Tasks requiring up to 1 minute per caster level require a payment of 50 gp per HD of the called dragon. For a task requiring up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 250 fp per HD. Long-term tasks (those requiring up to 1 day per caster level) require a payment of 500 gp per HD).
Especially hazardous tasks require a greater gift, up to twice the given amount. A dragon never accepts less than the indicated amount, even for a nonhazardous task.
At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for elapses, the creature returns to the place it was called from (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).

This effect does not grant the creatures the ability to learn more spells.
When a spell is traded, it is no longer in the repertoire of the trader.
Each participant must expend XP equal to 100 times the minimum caster level necessary to cast the spell.

They agree that Darsikh will give Arethnektilhimon hallucinatory terrain in return for shadow conjuration.
When the trade is decided and the spell cast, each expends 800 XP (100 &#215; 8, since 8 is the minimum caster level necessary for sorcerers to cast 4th-level spells).

Once created, the **dragonmark demesne** cannot move. The top hemisphere can hold as many as twenty-five Medium creatures. Creatures outside the sphere cannot enter it without your permission, but any creature inside the sphere can move freely out of it. You can remove yourself from the sphere without ending the spell, but while you are outside the **dragonmark demesne**, you cannot use any of your dragonmark powers for as long as the sphere persists.
The temperature inside the **dragonmark demesne** is a steady 70° F. The sphere also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The sphere withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane or stronger wind destroys it (**DMG** 95). A <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/disintegrate--2801/">**disintegrate**</a> spell also destroys a **dragonmark demesne**.

The spell protects your equipment as well.
Whenever you are exposed to energy damage, a multi-hued aura covers your body and absorbs up to 1d6 points per caster level (maximum 15d6) of whatever type of energy triggered the effect.
The protective aura lasts for 1 round or until it absorbs all the damage it can, whichever comes first.
Once the aura begins absorbing damage, you cannot change the type of damage it absorbs.
Energy buffer overlaps (and does not stack with) endure elements, resist elements, and protection from elements.
If you are warded by energy buffer and one or more of the other spells, the energy buffer spell absorbs damage until it is exhausted, no matter what type of energy the other spells ward against.
If you are subjected to a second type of energy after energy buffer is activated, any warding spell that protects you from the second type of energy is still effective.
For example, Mialee casts energy buffer on herself and also receives protection from elements (fire) and resist elements (cold) from Jozan.
Later, a white dragon and a group of ogres ambush Mialee's party.
The ogres hurl flasks of alchemist's fire at Mialee, which triggers her energy buffer spell.
The buffer easily absorbs all the fire damage Mialee would have suffered, and the protection from elements (fire) spell absorbs nothing.
Later, in the surprise round, the white dragon looses its breath weapon.
Because Mialee's energy buffer spell is absorbing fire damage, it is ineffective against the cold damage the dragon's breath weapon deals, but Mialee still gets the benefit of the resist elements (cold) spell}}

Even though the rune has disappeared, you feel as though you can step back to it simply by willing it.
You create a magical mark that you can teleport to at a moment's notice.
Upon casting this spell and touching a surface or inanimate object, you create an invisible rune like that created by the spell arcane mark (PH 201).
At any point during the spell's duration you can teleport (as the greater teleport spell) back to the mark as a swift action.
This ends the spell's duration.
After teleporting in this way, you can't take any other actions until your next turn.
The mark created by this spell can be detected in the same ways that an invisible arcane mark can be.
You are not alerted if the mark is dispelled or the object upon which it is inscribed is destroyed.
Any attempt to teleport back to a dispelled or destroyed mark still requires a swift action but fails.
If you created the evacuation rune upon a portable object, that object can be moved by another creature.
You have no knowledge of whether your mark has been moved or where, and upon teleporting to its location, you are subject to any adverse conditions.
If the mark has been moved to another plane, any attempt to teleport to it fails.
If the object inscribed with the evacuation rune is moved somewhere too small for you to appear or is otherwise covered by a solid body, you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location.
If there is no free space within 100 feet, you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet.
If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you take an additional 4d6 points of damage, and the teleport attempt simply fails.

In one stands a demon, and in the other stands your willing subject.
After an hour-long ritual incantation, you pull a roiling black cloud of demonic essence out of the demon and channel it into the willing recipient.
You transfer a portion of a demon's essence into a willing creature, enhancing one of its ability scores or skills.
The demon must be either allied and willing or captured and constrained (as if by a planar binding spell).
An unwilling demon can make a Will save to negate the effects of the spell.
Both the recipient and the donor demon must remain within specially prepared circles inscribed on the floor for the entire casting time.
These circles are similar to summoning circles and can be integrated into a summoning circle without impacting the function of either spell, but neither the demon nor the recipient need be summoned specifically into the circle for this spell's circle&#8212;each needs only to stand within it during the casting.
The benefit granted by this spell can be applied to one of the recipient's ability scores (as an enhancement bonus) or to one of his skills (as a competence bonus), as you designate.
Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed, and the effect cannot be dispelled except by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.
If you wish, you can increase the save DC for this spell by allowing the demon power over the target.
The specific concessions you can make to the demon and the corresponding increases to the save DC are given below.
+1 Increase: The donor demon can track the recipient's location and condition, effectively gaining the effect of a constant status spell on it.
+3 Increase: The demon can see through the recipient's eyes and hear through its ears.
+5 Increase: The demon can telepathically communicate with the recipient as if by Rary's telepathic bond.
+7 Increase: The demon can use demand on the recipient once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals your caster level at the time you cast extract gift).
The effects of the concessions are cumulative, but the save DC increases do not stack.
Thus, allowing the demon to track the recipient, use its senses, and communicate with it telepathically would increase the save DC by 5.
Increasing the save DC in this manner is an evil act, since it grants the demon more than the usual opportunity to work its evil.
Thus, using this option adds the evil descriptor to the spell.
Ability Bonus: The recipient gains an enhancement bonus to one ability score of your choice.
The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.
The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-fourth of your caster level (rounded down).
Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +2 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +5 bonus at 20th level.
You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.
The donor demon's ability modifier for the corresponding score must be at least twice that of the granted bonus.
Thus, to grant a +2 bonus to Dexterity, you must extract essence from a demon with a Dexterity score of at least 18 (such as a marilith).
To grant a +5 bonus to Charisma, you need a demon with a Charisma score of at least 30 (such as a lilitu).
Skill Bonus: The recipient gains a competence bonus on checks made with one skill of your choice.
The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.
The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-half your caster level (rounded down).
Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +4 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +10 bonus at 20th level.
You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.
The donor demon's ranks in the selected skill must be at least twice the granted bonus.
Thus, to grant a +5 bonus on Disable Device checks, you must extract essence from a demon with at least 10 ranks in Disable Device (such as a babau).
To grant a +10 bonus on Bluff checks, you need a demon with at least 20 ranks in Bluff (such as a balor).
Material Component: The circles in which the donor and recipient stand during the casting must be inscribed with expensive paints made from powdered diamonds, cold iron, blood, and various rare and exotic pigments.
Each circle must also be decorated with five flawless sapphires, which serve as conduits between the donor demon and the recipient.
The total cost of these pigments and gems depends on the nature and magnitude of the bonus to be imparted.
For an ability bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 1,000 gp (1,000 gp for +1, 4,000 gp for +2, 9,000 gp for +3, 16,000 gp for +4, and 25,000 gp for +5).
For a skill bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 100 gp (100 gp for +1, 400 gp for +2, 900 gp for +3, 1,600 gp for +4, 2,500 gp for +5, 3,600 gp for +6, 4,900 gp for +7, 6,400 gp for +8, 8,100 gp for +9, and 10,000 gp for +10).
XP Cost: You must spend XP equal to 1/25 the required cost of the material components when you cast this spell}}

Each tentacle deals 1d4 points of damage, plus your Strength modifier.
When using the tentacles, you are treated as though you have the Improved Grapple feat.
You can latch a tentacle onto a foe's head with a successful grapple check, and if you begin your turn with one tentacle successfully attached, you can attach the remaining three with a single check, though doing this still requires a full-round action.
Your foe can escape with a single grapple check or Escape Artist check, but you gain a +2 bonus for each tentacle that is attached at the beginning of your foe's turn.
If you begin your turn with all four tentacles attached, you can attempt to remove your foe's brain, killing him instantly.
The victim is entitled to a fortitude save to avoid this fate, though success indicates only that he evaded extraction; he is still grappled and must attempt to escape normally.
You cannot use these tentacles to grapple foes more than one size category larger or smaller than you.

However, you are capable of controlling the timing of your blinks and therefore make better use of them.
Blinking by means of this spell has several effects: Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help the attacker.
If the attack is capable of striking invisible or incorporeal creatures, the miss chance is only 20%.
An attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures takes no penalty.
You have no chance of interfering with your own attacks.
Individually targeted spells have a 50% chance to fail against you while blinking, unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures.
You have no chance of interfering with your own spells.
You take only half damage from area attacks (or full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
While blinking, you strike as an invisible creature (+2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.
You take only half damage from falling, since you are subject to gravity only while you are on the Material Plane.
You can ready an action to blink away from a specific enemy attack, physical or magical.
If you do so, the attack misses automatically unless it can
also affect ethereal targets.
You move at three-quarters speed, since movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.
While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects.
You do not risk materializing inside a solid object unless you actually end your move inside one, in which case you materialize and are shunted off to the nearest open space.
You take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet traveled in this manner.
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.
You interact with ethereal creatures in roughly the same way you interact with material ones (their attacks have a 50% miss chance against you, and so on)}}

While under the effect of this spell, a creature is infused with the disruptive power of an orthon.
As an immediate action, the subject of this spell can erect a 20-foot-radius field that disrupts teleportation spells or effects.
All creatures in the area are prevented from using any spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that provides such movement, as if they were in the area of a dimensional lock spell.
Each use of this field lasts 1 round.
In addition, the subject of the spell gains the benefit of a sonic shield for as long as the spell remains in effect.
This shield functions like the fire shield spell, except that it deals sonic damage instead of cold or fire, and the subject takes half damage from acid-based attacks.
If exposed to an acid attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, the subject takes no damage on a successful save.
The subject gains resistance to fire 10.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the orthon).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.

Changing shape in this way requires as much time as the target creature's ability normally requires, but it can perform additional actions as it chooses (so long as it has actions remaining in the round).
Each time that a creature affected by this spell changes shape, it experiences wracking pain, taking 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum 15 points). Target creatures who are able to adopt more than one alternative form can choose which form involuntary shapeshifting forces them to take. If the target of the spell does not have an alternative form available, or if the target's alternative form cannot be assumed (for instance, while a creature with a supernatural change shape ability is within an antimagic field), the spell has no effect}}

The ghost clings to the bearer's back or chest in the form of a tattoo for the duration of the spell.
Leech ghost skill binds only the ghost, not any of its equipment.
While this ghostly tattoo is in place, the bearer may use the ghost's skill ranks instead of his own as desired, regardless of the nature of the skill.
For example, a bearer wearing a ghost rogue/wizard tattoo could use the ghost's ranks in Climb, Hide, Knowledge, Spellcraft, or any of the ghost's other skills (including class-exclusive skills that the bearer does not possess) if they exceed his own.
He still uses his own ability modifiers for making skill checks.
The bearer does not have access to any of the ghost's other abilities or to any knowledge that is not related to skills (such as bardic knowledge, class abilities, ghost powers, memories, racial bonuses, and so on), nor does he gain the ability to speak or understand any languages that the ghost knows.
The ghost cannot be attacked or harmed while bound to the target.
The ghost remains completely aware of its surroundings, though it cannot speak or use any abilities (including mental communication).
When the spell ends, the ghost is immediately freed and appears in an area adjacent to the bearer.
If the bearer is killed by any means (even disintegrate or some other effect that destroys his body), the ghost is immediately freed and appears in the bearer's square.
When it appears, the ghost has all the abilities it had at the time of the binding (such as prepared spells or available spell slots, uses of turn undead, and so on).
This spell was invented by members of the Piran Sedestadel at the behest of the Yisa-khardomas, who sought a way to punish criminal ghosts and still let them contribute to life in the city.

If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails.
Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters.
If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum.
If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold.
If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal).
The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp.
Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy.
(The replica costs 50 gp).
You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time&#8212;even a wish spell does not allow more.
The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica.
The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane.
You need the replica to recall the chest.
After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost.
If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.
Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive}}

By casting this spell, you become more formidable in aerial combat, allowing you to deal with airborne enemies more easily.
You can fly at a speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability (or 30 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor, or carry a medium or heavy load).
If you already have a fly speed of 40 feet or greater, your fly speed improves by 10 feet, and your maneuverability improves to good (unless it's already better than that).
While airborne, you can use a swift action each round to fire a bolt of magical lightning as a ranged touch attack against any other airborne target within 60 feet.
This attack deals 1 point of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20 points) and reduces the target's fly speed to 1/2 normal for the duration of the spell.
This speed reduction doesn't stack, so attacking the same target multiple times yields no extra reduction in fly speed (but continues to deal damage).
Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate one lightning bolt (as the spell) as a standard action.
Doing so ends the duration of lord of the sky, and if you do not have a natural fly speed, you drift to the ground as per the fly spell.
Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), this spell grants you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 if encumbered as described above).
Dragonblooded casters who already have a fly speed of 60 feet or greater instead gain a +10-foot improvement to their fly speed}}

In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.
(Undead creatures are powered by negative energy.
Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls).
For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within the range, all powered by positive energy.
You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.
Attempting to possess a body is a fullround action.
It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward.
You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save.
Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.
If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar.
You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.
The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities.
For example, a fish's body breathes water and a troll's body regenerates.
A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities.
The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.
As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body.
The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.
If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead).
If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die.
Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.
If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed).
If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range).
Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or at the host's location}}

The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.
Dispel evil cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the nightmare and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the dispel evil.

Each round as a move action, you can direct the orb of dancing death to attack another creature within range (including the previous target, if desired). If not directed, the orb returns to your side.
If a creature has at least as many negative levels as HD, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest available level. Negative levels stack.
Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the victim's levels, but the negative levels from the orb of dancing death don't last long enough to do so.

An invisible force, not unlike the product of an <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/unseen-servant--2468/">**unseen servant**</a> spell (PH 297), comes into being where you wish. On your turn, this force steals objects from others as you inaudibly direct it (a free action). A phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature or can pick up an unattended object, as long as the object weighs no more than 1 pound per caster level. It cannot break into locked chests. A phantasmal thief has a Hide modifier (useful against those who can see invisible creatures) and a Move Silently modifier both equal to your caster level.
If a phantasmal thief goes undetected, it can steal any object a creature possesses but is not holding or wearing. Even objects in a bag of holding can be stolen. It can steal objects, bring objects to you, or put them back where they came from. It can take no other actions. A phantasmal thief needs 1 round to steal an object and another round to bring it to you.
A phantasmal thief can hold only one object at a time, and the object becomes invisible in its grasp. A thief cannot take an item if it is detected by the creature it's trying to steal from (with a Listen or Spot check). However, the thief can repeat the attempt in the next round. It cannot be harmed in any way, although it can be dispelled.
A phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature's hand by making a successful disarm attempt. It does so with a bonus on the disarm check equal to your caster level. If a phantasmal thief is used in this way, it disappears after it brings the stolen object to you.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward.
The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated.
If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.
The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw.
If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell.
If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).
The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier).
It can try each method once per day.
If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.
A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel.
You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil, page 246) to make the trap more secure.
If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare.
You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward.
You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check.
The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward.
If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service.
New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours.
This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell.
Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.
If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.
Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.
The creature might later seek revenge.
If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as &quot;Wait here&quot; or &quot;Defend this area against attack&quot;), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.
Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
For example, lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental}}

These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.
While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.
When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well.
A sample command: &quot;Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures&quot;. The phrase &quot;Surround me&quot; directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A &quot;peasant&quot; that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger an eye's return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring.
Another sample command: &quot;Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return&quot;. The phrase &quot;Spread out&quot; directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him.
Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions.
In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.
If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.
The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. **Dispel magic** can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself}}

Your shadowy form also  provides you with concealment. This shadowy concealment is not negated by a see invisibility spell, but a true seeing spell counteracts the effect. Standing within the radius of a daylight spell or in bright  natural sunlight temporarily suppresses the concealment effect.
In addition, if you have 5 ranks in Escape Artist, you can attempt to slip through a solid object or barrier up to 5 feet thick with a DC 20 Escape Artist check, though doing this ends the spell as soon as the attempt is completed (regardless of success).

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.
**Sustained Force:** A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.
This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.
An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require  Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM.
**Combat Maneuver:** Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you  cease concentration.
**Violent Thrust:** Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object  or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).
You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).
Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves  (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points)}}

Interplanar travel is not possible.
You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.
You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels.
A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.
All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you.
Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.
You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination.
You can't simply teleport to the warlord's tent if you don't know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what's in it.
The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works.
Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.
To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table.
Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
Familiarity: &quot;Very familiar&quot; is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.
&quot;Studied carefully&quot; is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour.
&quot;Seen casually&quot; is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar.
&quot;Viewed once&quot; is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.
&quot;False destination&quot; is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on a enemy's sanctum but instead viewed a false vision, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground).
When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.
On Target: You appear where you want to be.
Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
Distance off target is 1d10&#215;1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled.
For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target.
That's 18 miles, in this case.
The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth.
If you were teleporting to a coastal city and would up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.
A wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory.
Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range.
If the DM determines no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.
Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten &quot;scrambled&quot;.
You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up.
For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.
Each time &quot;Mishap&quot; comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll}}

If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud.
Magical stone is not affected by the spell.
The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet.
A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC.
Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it.
Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.
If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet.
For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud.
Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet.
The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.
However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance&#8212;but not necessarily its form.
Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.
The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

Any creature in the sand is allowed a Reflex save to escape before the area is hardened to glass.
Creatures unable to escape the area become trapped and must be broken out.
A creature so caught can break free by making a Strength check to break the glass or by dealing damage to the glass.
Glass has hardness 1, 1 hit point per inch of thickness, and a break DC of 12, +1 per inch of thickness.
A creature partially caught in the glass takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity, and is unable to move.
When breaking glass, a creature takes 1d6 points of damage each time it makes a successful Strength check to break free.
If broken free by others, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage from broken glass.
A creature trapped beneath the surface of the glass may begin to suffocate (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into a heap of sand.
Magical stone is not affected by this spell.
The depth of the sand created cannot exceed 10 feet.
If transmute stone to sand is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the sand falls to the floor and scatters in a pile 5 feet deep.
For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into sand.
Piling on the floor, this sand would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet.
The falling sand and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
Castles and large stone buildings generally have immunity to this spell, since transmute stone to sand can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.
However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
The sand remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute sand to stone spell restores its substance&#8212;though not necessarily its form.

This spell functions like lesser planar binding, except that you can call a single creature of CR 6 or less, and you must know its personal truename to call it.
Once you demonstrate mastery of that truename with a successful Truespeak check, you can compel the creature to perform a service on your behalf if you roll a 1 on the Truespeak check required by this spell, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.
The creature gets its Will save and spell resistance as normal for lesser planar binding.
If the creature does not break free, you attempt to compel the creature to perform a service not with opposed Charisma checks, but with the Truespeak check you made when you cast the spell.
The bound creature opposes this check with either a Truespeak check, saying its own personal truename, or a Charisma check.
If you can assign an open-ended task, such as &quot;defend me against attack&quot;, the service lasts for one day.
Once the requested service is performed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.
You can extend the creature's duration of service with a particularly high Truespeak check.
For every 5 points by which your Truespeak check (made when you cast the spell) exceeds the creature's Truespeak or Charisma check, the duration of the creature's service is extended by one additional day.

For example, a 10th-level sorcerer who spent two 5th-level spell slots (one to cast the spell and another to enhance it) would heal 10d6 points of damage.

When you attack with a **viscid glob,** you make a ranged touch attack against the target. If you miss, the glob might strike a nearby square or creature (see Missing with a Thrown Weapon, **PH** 158). Once you have established the direction of the miss, roll 1d4 to determine the number of squares away from the target square that the glob lands.
A Medium or smaller creature struck by the glob must make a successful Reflex save or be instantly stuck in place. A stuck creature can speak but is otherwise limited to purely mental actions (such as casting spells with no somatic or material components) and attempts to free itself by means of a Strength check or <a href="/skills/escape-artist/">Escape Artist</a> check (against a DC equal to this spell's DC) made as a full-round action. A Large or larger creature stuck in the goo can't move from the spot where it is glued, but it can otherwise act normally.
The glob dissipates when the spell duration expires. Until then, it remains sticky, and any creature touching it (for example, a creature attempting to pull out an ally) must make a successful Reflex save or become stuck itself. A creature stuck by such secondary contact is not trapped as thoroughly as a creature targeted by the glob, however, so the DC of the Strength check or <a href="/skills/escape-artist/">Escape Artist</a> check required to get free is reduced by 5.

It merges into adjoining rock surfaces, melting the rock at the point of connection to form a smooth bond.
The wall can seal off a passage or breach, but the intense heat causes flammable materials in contact with the wall of magma to catch fire instantly.
A wall of magma is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
You can shape a wall of magma into sheets and curves, but the molten wall cannot form domes or unsupported horizontal surfaces more than 5 feet across.

The wall cannot hold complex forms such as crenellations.
It is possible (though difficult) to form the wall into a ring to enclose creatures, but they can avoid this with successful Reflex saves.
The wall sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet.
Unlike a wall of fire, both sides of a wall of magma radiate heat.
Since it is molten, the wall cannot be broken as such, but an object or creature could force its way through.
It costs 4 squares of movement to move through a square containing a wall of magma, but creatures of the earth subtype can pass through the wall at normal speed.
A wall of magma deals 5d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to creatures passing through it, the same amount each round to any creature within it, and 2d6 points of fire damage per round for 1d3 rounds after a creature leaves the area of the wall.
It deals double damage to undead and creatures with the water subtype.
The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell.
If any 5-foot section of the wall takes 40 points of cold damage or more in a round, that section hardens into normal stone (hardness 8, 15 hit points per inch of thickness), which can then be chipped or broken as normal (DC 20 Strength check, +2 per inch of thickness).
Do not divide cold damage by four, as normal for objects.
Casting create water on the surface of a wall of magma creates a cloud of steamy fog that fills a cube with the dimensions of the length of wall affected.
The fog dissipates after 10 minutes.
Only the surface of the stone hardens; the wall is not cooled completely.
Wall of magma can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent wall of magma that is chilled by cold damage stays solid for 10 minutes, then returns to its molten state}}

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
It must always be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.
A wall of ooze is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
The caster can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 50 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 0.
A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 +2 per inch of thickness.
Any creature touching the wall takes 2d6 points of acid damage per round from the corrosive, burning nature of the ooze.
Only the surrounding material that the wall initially is conjured to touch&#8212;such as the floor or an adjoining wall&#8212;is immune to this damage.
Furthermore, a creature that touches the wall must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed by the ooze.
The wall then consumes the creature in 1d6 rounds, digesting it and adding the creature's full normal hit point total to its own.

It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.
A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell's area by half.
Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

The watchware is activated when the item is disturbed for any reason, whether someone touches it or pokes it with a pole, a cat walks on it, or an earthquake knocks it over.
The watchware functions only once and is then discharged.
Since its components are expensive, most sorcerers and wizards reserve watchware to protect valuable, out-of-the-way items.
A watchware is a magical trap.
A rogue can find a watchware with a successful Search check (DC 25 + spell level, or 30 for watchware) and disarm it with a successful Disable Device check (DC 25 + spell level, or 30 for watchware).
You can designate a password that allows another creature to handle the object without sounding the mental alarm if you so choose.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.
An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. 
Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result). 
A normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field.
Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more about artifacts).

The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead.
The spell to be brought into effect by the contingency must be one that affects your person (feather fall, levitate, fly,
teleport, and so forth) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).
The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general.
For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might prescribe that any time you are plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the water breathing spell instantly comes into effect.
Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time you fall more than 4 feet.
In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being &quot;cast&quot; instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur.
If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when called on.
The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.

Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch).
The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long.
In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates).
The spell has no effect on other creatures.
Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower.
Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates.
If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.
With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.

Each time demonic blood infusion is cast upon a creature it must attempt a Will saving throw.
Failure means the subject becomes chaotic if it was not already.
If the subject is chaotic but nonevil, failure causes it to become evil.

As you prepare your next attack, you know that the possessing spirit will remember this fight.**
When this spell is cast on a possessed creature, the pos­sessing spirit is temporarily bound within its host and inextricably locked to that host's life force. If the fleshbound creature takes damage, the possessing spirit feels its pain.
While under the effect of this spell, the host creature automatically falls under the complete control of the possessing spirit (<span class="caps">ECS</span> 101). For the purpose of combat, the fleshbound creature uses its own attacks and special abili­ties, but does not gain any additional abilities not already granted by being possessed.
Each round as a full-round action, a fleshbound crea­ture can make a special Will save (DC equal to spell's save DC minus possessing spirit's HD + your caster level). A quori spirit possessing an Inspired host can add the levels of the host body to its Hit Dice for the purpose of resisting this spell. If the spirit succeeds on the save, it can abandon the host body as a free action. If it chooses not to abandon the host, the possessing spirit remains bound.
Any attack that deals hit point damage or ability damage to the host creature deals the same damage to the possessing spirit. The possessing spirit cannot be killed in this way, but if it or the host creature is taken to 0 or fewer hit points, the possessing spirit is forced from the body as if subject to a dismissal spell. Also, its psychic wounds prevent it from possessing any other host for a number of days (as reckoned on the Material Plane) equal to the amount of hit point damage and ability damage dealt to it.
**Material Component:** A sphere of volcanic glass, which is shattered as the spell is cast.}}

If your ranged touch attack succeeds, you charge the target with an intensely powerful magical magnetism effect.
You can only affect objects made of metal or creatures wearing or carrying metal armor, weapons, or gear.
The magical magnetism generated by Ghorus Toth's magnetism creates a zone of attraction with a radius of 30 feet around the affected creature or object.
Every metallic object entering the zone of attraction is pulled toward the target creature or object by this attractive force, which has an effective Strength score of 10 + the caster's level (maximum 25).
Every round metal creatures or objects remain within the zone of attraction, they must attempt an opposed Strength check against the force.
If an attracted creature wins this contest, it suffers no ill effects this round.
If it fails, it is entangled and drawn 10 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which it failed the opposed Strength check closer to the creature or object at the center of the zone.
Creatures carrying or holding metal objects may choose to release them, in which case the items fly to the creature or object at the center, or hold onto them, in which case they are treated as metal creatures.
Unattended metal objects of 50 pounds or less in the zone of attraction (including items voluntarily released, as well as metallic projectiles fired through the zone) fly with great force and strike the target, dealing 1d6 points of damage per 5 pounds of weight (maximum 10d6).
Objects heavier than 50 pounds are dragged 10 feet closer each round.
Metal creatures or objects that reach the target of Ghorus Toth's magnetism become stuck fast to the target.
(If the target is a metal or metal-armored creature, it is instantly stuck fast to itself by the spell).
Creatures stuck together this way are considered to be grappled and must first escape the grapple by defeating the attractive force in an opposed Strength check before they
can try to move away or take any actions prohibited in a grapple.
Similarly, an object stuck to the target must be wrested away with a Strength check before it can be used.
If a creature or object within the zone of attraction is more than twice as heavy as the target of Ghorus Toth's magnetism,
the target is dragged to it instead.
This naturally moves the zone of attraction, which may shift other creatures into or out of the magnetism's range of influence}}

The shaking hand gets one grapple attack per round.
Its grapple bonus against another magic hand is your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively), +9 for the hand's Strength score (29), +4 for being Large.
Once grappled, a magic hand can only escape the shaking hand by making an opposed grapple check, unless the duration of the grappled hand exceeds the duration of the shaking hand.
In cases where no Strength score is given, assume the magic hand has a Strength score of 17 + twice the level of the spell.
Once a grapple is broken, nothing prevents your shaking hand from attempting another grapple attack.
For example, a wizard uses Halaster's shaking hand to grapple a sorcerer's Bigby's forceful hand, rolls a 10 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Intelligence score (18), adds +9 for the hand's Strength score (29), and adds +4 for the hand's size (Large), for a total of 27.
The sorcerer seeks to break the handshake; he rolls a 14 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Charisma score (18), adds +8 for the hand's Strength score (27), and adds +4 for the hand's size (Large) for a total of 30.
The &quot;handshake&quot; (grapple) lasts for at least 1 more round.

A warm red glow emits from your hands, strengthening the object.**
This spell increases the hardness of materials. Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more resilient, and so on. For every two caster levels, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material's resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (treat steel as iron, base hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have hardness 16 for the purpose of ignoring damage caused by someone making a sunder attack. The sword's hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. A hardening spell does not in any way affect a substance's resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on.
This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet of material per level of the caster. If cast upon a metal or mineral, the spell affects only 1 cubic foot per level.
Material Component: An ointment made with 50 gp of diamond dust per 10 cubic feet of material}}

The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ice can't move or attack.
A spellcaster on the ice must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.
The ice rift affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an ice rift spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
Ice or Snow Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and burying that creature in snow.
An ice rift cast on the roof of a very large ice or snow cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Edge of a Glacier: Ice rift causes a glacier's edge to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An ice rift cast at the top of a 100-foot glacier would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the glacier.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath rubble (see below).
Open Glacier: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.
Fissures open in the ice, and every creature on the ice has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
Frozen Water: Fissures open in the ice, and every creature on the ice has a 25% chance to fall into the freezing water (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
Characters who fall into a fissure are immediately subject to hypothermia and take 2d6 points of cold damage from the frigid water.
At the end of the spell, all rents in the ice grind shut, sealing any creatures in the icy water beneath (for additional rules on characters in cold water, see Hypothermia, page 10)}}

Your familiar gives you a knowing nod.**
This spell allows you to transfer a number of your spells and the ability to cast them into your familiar. Spontaneous spellcasters, such as sorcerers, can imbue a familiar with any spells they know how to cast, subject to the restrictions below. Arcanists who prepare spells, such as wizards, can imbue a familiar with any spell they have currently prepared. In either case, you can imbue one spell per three caster levels, with a maximum spell level of one-third your caster level, rounded down (maximum 5th level). Multiple castings of imbue familiar with spell ability have no effect on these limits.
The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and so on) function according to your level. Once you cast imbue familiar with spell ability on your familiar, both the spell slot from which you cast the spell and the spell slots of the transferred spells remain unavailable for the preparation or casting of new spells  until  the  familiar  uses  the transferred spells or imbue familiar with spell ability expires.
The spell can be dispelled; if this happens,  the  spells  transferred  are lost as if the familiar had cast them. In an antimagic field, the familiar loses the ability to cast the imbued spells, but regains it again if it leaves the field (as long as the spell's duration hasn't expired).
If any transferred spell requires a focus or material component, you must have it on your person when the spells are cast (components are consumed as normal without requiring you to bring them to hand). Any XP costs from a transferred spell are deducted from your total when the familiar casts the spell}}

If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4&#215;10 minutes.
If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth.
When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind.
These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known.
If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information.
As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are &quot;legendary&quot;, as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.
Examples of legend lore results include the following.
A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: &quot;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones.
Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'
on the lips&quot;.
A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: &quot;Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life.
He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain&quot;.
(The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain).
A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: &quot;The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods.
Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day&quot;.
(These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore)}}

Effect: 40-ft.-radius spread
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text
Spell Resistance: No
You create a landslide of mud and water, which crushes, buries, and mires those caught in its path.
The mud covers the area of the spell to a depth of about 10 feet (although it might fill low-lying areas or fail to cover high points in the area, at the DM's discretion).
Creatures within the spell's effect must make a Reflex save.
Those who fail take 8d6 points of damage and are buried (see Avalanches on page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Those who succeed take 3d6 points of damage and are not buried.
Creatures of the fire subtype who are actually aflame (such as salamanders, azers, and fire elementals) instead take 8d8 or 3d8 points of damage, respectively.
A creature who escapes burial ends up on top of the mudslide, mired in deep mud.
After the initial slide, the mudslide persists indefinitely, producing an area of deep bog (average depth 10 feet) until the water in it evaporates.
It requires 4 squares of movement to enter 1 square of deep bog, and running or charging are impossible in the area.
Underwater, the mudslide remains indefinitely, producing an area of deep muck.
It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square containing deep muck, the DC of Balance and Tumble checks increases by 5, and the DC of Move Silently checks increases by 2.
Aboveground, the mud normally dries out in 2 to 3 days.

An elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8).

An undead that was destroyed with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being revived, in addition to losing spells for losing a level.

You can see and hear what occurs at a location, which can be at any distance on the same plane where you are located.
You must make a successful caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) to scry a specific location.
The difficulty of this check depends on how familiar you are with that location and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that place.
Furthermore, the difficulty to scry the desired locale increases if the location is extremely far removed, indoors or underground, or on another plane.
The DC of this check is 20 + any modifiers related to your knowledge of the area, your connection to it, and the location's distance, as set out in the following table.
If you fail this check, the scrying attempt simply fails.
If the caster level check succeeds, you create an invisible magical sensor in any location you desire.
Through this sensor you can both see and hear, your vantage and range of vision being the same as if you were actually at that place, allowing you to make Spot and Listen checks as normal.
You can rotate the sensor as you wish, seeing in any direction you desire.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow.
The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.
You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane.
Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end.
It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.
Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10&#215;100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint.
If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10&#215;1,000 feet in the same direction.
If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).
Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.
The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.
They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you).
Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful}}

Upon choosing the target of your spell, you sense the shadowy force depart from your side, moving as fast as thought toward the creature you designated as your target. You see the target creature move as if attacked by an unseen foe.**
Upon casting this spell, you create a shadowy force that automatically grabs the target (PH 156). The shadowy force immediately attempts to establish a hold on the target with a grapple check bonus equal to the DC of this spell. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the grapple check bonus of the shadowy grappler is cut in half. For example, a sorcerer with a 16 Charisma who casts this spell creates a shadowy grappler with a grapple check bonus of +19 if the target fails its save and +9 if the target makes its save.
Every round on your turn, the shadowy grappler makes a grapple check against the target. Once it has  a hold, the shadowy force attempts to pin the target on the following round. If the grappler establishes a pin, it uses the option to prevent the target from speaking. The grappler always attempts to maintain a grapple or work toward a pin.
A shadowy grappler occupies the same square as the target and moves with the target for as long as the spell lasts. Other creatures cannot join the grapple, either to assist the target or the grappler.

Once you summon a disk, a single spell of up to 5th level can be cast into it, either by you or by another spellcaster.
If no spell is cast into the disk within 10 minutes of its creation, it vanishes into nothingness and the spell is wasted.
The disk stores an imbued spell indefinitely until it is shattered (a standard action requiring only 1 point of damage or a DC 5 Strength check).
At that point, the spell immediately takes effect as if it had just been cast by the spellcaster who first placed it in the disk.
Touch-range spells and spells that have specific targets (such as cause critical wounds or expeditious retreat) are targeted upon the creature or object that shattered the disk, while area and effect spells are triggered as though the broken disk were the spell's point of origin.
For example, a stored fireball would detonate in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the disk, whereas a flame blade would appear in the hand of the creature that shattered the disk.
If the spell stored in the disk does not have a valid target (such as a disk imbued with cause critical wounds that is broken by a falling rock), the spell simply fails to manifest and is wasted.

If the dragon hits with its bite, the target takes 1d6 points of Strength damage and gains one negative level.
After 24 hours, the victim is entitled to a Fortitude save to avoid losing the level permanently.
The mass itself is not dangerous to the touch, and creatures can pass through it without suffering harm.
A spectral dragon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation,
or a rod of cancellation affects it.
Its AC against touch attacks is 9 (10 minus size bonus for a Large creature).
It can pass through solid objects, though it has no ability to see through them.
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spectral dragon strikes it.
If the attack is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled.
If not, the dragon has its full normal effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
An undead creature struck by the dragon's bite receives 1d4&#215;3 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.
Special: Shadow creatures (such as shadows, shadow dragons, and shadar-kai) and creatures descended from shadow (such as half-shadow dragons and shadovar) cast this spell at +1 caster level and deal an extra 1 point of Strength damage with each attack.
This bonus is also granted to creatures that derive their power from the Shadow Weave}}

An outsider attempts a Fortitude save and checks spell resistance when it first enter the spell's area.

Outsiders that fail their saves and have their spell resistance overcome by the spell are affected as long as they remain within the spell's area, and they are automatically affected if they leave and reenter the area.

You place a protective spell upon your hand that allows you to touch an untriggered magic sigil (such as a glyph of warding or a symbol of death) without setting it off. The touched sigil is removed from its location and held as magical potential on your hand, as though it were a touch spell.
To pick up a sigil in this manner, you must make a successful caster level check (DC 20 + the target glyph's spell level). Failure indicates that you have triggered the glyph or symbol. If you successfully transfer the sigil to your hand, you can use a standard action to place it on a surface (not a creature) of the sort on which it can normally be scribed. The transferred sigil works normally thereafter and retains all its original triggering conditions, although its current location might make its triggers difficult or impossible to achieve.
You can maintain the magic sigil on your hand as long as you concentrate. If your concentration lapses or the spell duration expires while the sigil is thus stored as potential, it immediately triggers upon you (and only you), even if you normally would not meet its same saving throw and spell resistance as the original spell did.

If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it.
The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed.
Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly.
A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over.
Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves.
Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage.

If you are not flying, you can use a standard action to make one wing attack or a full attack action to make two such attacks (as if they were natural weapons).
Each wing deals 2d6 points of slashing damage (plus your Strength modifier), and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.

1 full round                   1 standard action
2-10 rounds                  1 round less than normal
Arcane spellsurge has no effect on any spell with a casting time of greater than 1 minute or a casting time not listed on the table. You can't choose to ignore this effect; that is, you can't opt to cast a spell using its normal casting time. Thus, if all your spells normally have casting times of 1 standard action, they take 1 swift action instead, and because you can't take more than one swift action in a round, you won't be able to cast multiple spells per round while under the effect of arcane spellsurge. (If you have available spells with casting times of 1 full round, you are still able to cast more than one of those spells per round). However, a sorcerer or other spontaneous arcane caster could cast a metamagic spell (as a standard action) and a normal spell (as a swift action) in the same round.
This spell doesn't stack with any other effect that reduces a spell's casting time.

Energy Transformation Field(Spell Compendium): - Sorcerer(7)

Slowly it rises from your hand, emitting a soft beam that illuminates the chosen area. Then it disappears, and you place the spell within the magic trap.**
You create a lingering zone of transformative magic that absorbs magic energy from magic items or spellcasting and uses it to power another spell tied to that location. For example, you could have an **energy transformation field** tied to a **summon monster V** spell that would summon a monster when the field had absorbed enough magic.
The field absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities that are activated, and magic items used within its dimensions. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the field equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Super-natural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast **fireball** spell or a charge from a **wand of fireball** would add three spell levels to the field's store, a **potion of cure light wounds** would add one, and a **wish** from a **ring of three wishes** would add nine. Items that don't have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to create that item (so an **immovable rod** would provide two spell levels every time it was activated because of its **levitate** prerequisite). Effects that are absorbed give no indication of where the magic went; they simply vanish.
The field absorbs only magic that is actually used within its area. Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a +1 mace, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a **continual flame** would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected.
An **energy transformation field** has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field designated by you at the time of the casting of the field. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The field automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the duration of its previous casting has expired. If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the field expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field's concentration is interrupted only by its complete destruction). Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the field.
Typical spells linked to an energy transformation field are **blindness/deafness**, **fireball**, **suggestion**, **summon monster**, or **wall of force**. Spells that have a costly material component or an XP cost cannot be linked to a field, but those with a costly focus can if the focus object is present within the field (typically sealed into a wall or in a secret compartment).
Only **Mordenkainen's disjunction**, **limited wish**, **wish**, or similar spells can destroy the **energy transformation field**. Spells of lower level, such as **dispel magic** and **greater dispel magic**, are absorbed by it, and an **antimagic field** prevents it from absorbing magical energy within the field but does not otherwise hamper this spell. If two or more field spells share an overlapping area, each field has an equal chance of absorbing a spell effect in that area}}

As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral.
Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally.
Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.
An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk's gaze attack).
Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material.

You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps.
Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover.

If a warded character touches or attacks a dragon or the dragon's hoard, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.

The castle includes a single main gate and a sally port, a drawbridge, a 30-foot diameter central tower made of blue ice (see page 80), and one additional tower per 6 levels of the caster.
The size of the castle is determined by the location of the towers, which enclose an open courtyard.
The maximum perimeter of the structure is 20 feet per caster level.
In addition, you can place any or all of the following three magical effects in the castle.
1. Icicle spells in two areas (typically in the gatehouse and in the central tower).
Saving Throw: See text.
Spell Resistance: No.
2. Ice slick spells triggered an intruder steps on the tower stairs.
Saving Throw: See text.
Spell Resistance: No.
3. Obscuring snow in any corridors or rooms, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).
Creatures father away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
Saving Throw: None.
Spell Resistance: No.
The castle can be created around living creatures, and in this case it rises up from the earth and snow around them.
It cannot be &quot;dropped&quot; onto creatures as an offensive spell.
The caster may choose to be lifted onto the roof of the central tower by centering the spell on himself.
If the castle is summoned on relatively level ground, a moat of icy water 20 feet wide surrounds the castle.
If summoned on sharply sloping ground, an icy crevasse 20 feet wide and 50 feet deep surrounds the castle.
The castle melts slowly whenever the temperature rises above freezing; an ice castle takes 1d6 points of damage each round in a place with temperatures above freezing.
When struck by fire spells, the castle is damaged normally.
The castle has 200 hit points per 5-foot section and a hardness of 0.
The central tower is made of blue ice which has 300 hit points per 5-foot section and a hardness of 10 Creatures can hit the castle automatically.
Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt the ice castle, and it deals full damage to the structure (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).
Suddenly melting an ice castle creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes}}

In any round when the claw is grappling a target, it deals 1d8 points of cold damage.
The claw can attack in the round it appears. Directing it to change targets is a standard action. It always attacks from your direction and does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.

Then the light of a malevolent evil flares in the host's eyes as it rushes to attack, and you know you have only one chance.**
When this spell is cast on a possessed creature, the pos­sessing spirit is temporarily bound within its host and inextricably locked to that host's life force. If the lifebound creature is slain, both the host and the possessing spirit die.
While under the effect of this spell, the host creature automatically falls under the complete control of the pos­sessing spirit (<span class="caps">ECS</span> 101). For the purpose of combat, the lifebound creature uses its own attacks and special abilities (with any enhancements provided by the possession), but can make use of any of the possessing spirit's spell-like, psi-like, or supernatural abilities, even if the possess­ing spirit normally does not have use of those abilities while possessing the host creature. The lifebound creature makes use of the possessing spirit's abilities in ways that make sense for its own form. For example, an Inspired that has a tsucora quori spirit would gain that creature's terrifying sting supernatural ability, but would use the
ability through its natural attacks or weapon attacks (the Inspired's choice).
The possessing spirit takes no damage from attacks directed at the host creature. However, if a lifebound host is slain (taken to -10 hit points), the possessing spirit is instantly destroyed. The host creature can then be raised or resurrected if such magic is available.
Many outsiders are tied to the energy of their plane, and so are never permanently destroyed. For example, this spell could destroy the personality and memories of a particular quori spirit, but that spirit's energy returns to Dal Quor to eventually form a new quori of the same kind. However, a spirit destroyed by this spell cannot re­form for a number of weeks (as reckoned on the Material Plane) equal to its Hit Dice.
The magic needed to bind a possessing spirit to a host body is both powerful and unstable. As a result, neither the caster of this spell nor the possessing spirit or host creature knows the spell's duration, which is rolled in secret by the DM. Each round as a full-round action, the lifebound creature can make a special Will save (DC equal to spell's save DC minus possessing spirit's HD + your caster level). A quori spirit possessing an Inspired host can add the levels of the host body to its Hit Dice for the purpose of resisting this spell. If the spirit succeeds on the save, it can abandon the host body as a free action. If it chooses not to abandon the host, the possessing spirit remains bound}}

The spell lasts until the subject passes through a mirror again, either the same mirror or a related one.
On the Plane of Mirrors, you will find other windows that represent similar mirrors tied together by some strong bond.
Frequently they were all made by the same artisan, but mirrors with particularly strong-willed owners or mirrors made at a particular historic moment may also be tied together.
When on the Plane of Mirrors, you can see through these other mirrors without being seen, allowing you to spy on others.
You can reach through the mirror to grab items that are within easy reach, or even grapple with someone within arm's reach of the mirror.
A grappled individual will be drawn onto the Plane of Mirrors and becomes a new subject of the mirror walk spell.
For each subject, the mirror walk spell ends when a second mirror is passed through.
Other mirrorwalkers aren't affected.
Using the mirror walk spell is not without danger.

As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures.
It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19-20 and a critical multiplier of x2.
The sword always strikes from your direction.
It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one.
If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers.
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target.
If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target.
The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical
attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it.
The sword's AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time Mordenkainen's sword strikes it.

Upon completion of the spell, the subject can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the half-fiend template (see page 147 of the Monster Manual).
In addition, the subject's type changes to outsider, and the moral component of its alignment changes to evil.
For the purpose of this spell, treat the half-fiend template as an acquired template rather than an inherited one.
The newly created half-fiend also gains a +4 level adjustment, raising the XP required for it to achieve its next character level.
For example, a 5th-level sorcerer who becomes a half-fiend by means of this spell becomes a 9th-level character who needs 45,000 XP to gain his sixth class level.

Living creatures that rest in this area do not regain hit points or lost ability score points.
Undead in the area heal damage at the rate of 1 point per Hit Die every 24 hours.

two).
The instruction must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.
Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the instruction.
The instructed course of activity can continue for the entire duration.

You can instead specify conditions that trigger a special activity during the duration.
If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity is not performed.

If a common language is shared, you can force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of his abilities.
If no common language is shared, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.

The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. Thus, a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/charm-person--2535/">**charm person**</a> spell cast at you could be turned back upon the caster and possibly enable you to use the charm effect on that individual, but a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> could not be turned back, and neither could inflict critical wounds.
From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The DM secretly rolls the exact number. When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left. 
When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected. 
For example, if you had three levels of spell turning left and were targeted by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/magic-missile--2631/">**magic missile**</a> spell heightened to 4th level, you  would turn three-fourths of the spell back at the caster. You would take one-forth of the damage, while the caster takes three-fourths of the damage. If you were targeted by a wizard's <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fear--2736/">**fear**</a> spell (also a 4th-level spell) in the same situation, you would have a one in four (25%) chance to be affected by the spell, while the caster would have a three in four (75%) chance to be affected.
If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by **spell turning** effects in operation, a resonating field is created.

The stone remains there until triggered, either by special conditions set by you or by a command word you choose.
Once triggered, the stone trap turns visible and falls naturally.
The stone of the stone trap can be positioned so that it holds up additional material within the weight limit of the spell.
For example, a 2,200-pound stone with stone trap cast on it by a 13th-level cleric could support an additional 400 pounds.
This additional weight could be placed on top of the stone in midair, the stone could function as a plug in a hole in a ceiling, and so on.
As a trap, the suspended stone has an attack bonus equal to your caster level.
Any creatures hit by the stone when it falls take 1d6 points of damage for every 200 pounds of weight, plus 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet the stone falls, for a maximum of 20d6 points of damage.
Anything atop the stone might deal additional damage, but such supplementary material can only deal damage above and beyond the maximum (20d6) if it doesn't rely on the fall to deal that damage.
The conditions for triggering a stone trap can be as simple or as elaborate as you desire.
Special conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Other intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.
For example, a stone trap can be set to activate when a lawful evil creature approaches, but not when a blackguard approaches.

This more powerful variation of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/lightning-bolt--2630/">**lightning bolt**</a> deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to each creature within its area. You can choose whether the bolt is cast all at once or partially stored in a 5-foot-square metal or stone surface within range. When casting, in addition to selecting the path of the bolt, you decide how many dice to allocate to the initial lightning strike, how many to send into the storage surface, and how long (to a maximum of 5 rounds) before the stored lightning discharges. If all damage is allocated to the initial strike, no energy is stored; if all damage is allocated to be stored, the bolt appears to miss any targets in its path and strike the stone or metal surface harmlessly.
The initial strike does damage to all creatures within its area, as a lightning bolt spell. When released, the stored bolt deals damage to all creatures within a 60-foot-radius spread centered on the point where the bolt struck. The bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects, just as a normal lightning bolt. If the storage surface is an unbroken wall, damage extends in a semicircle from the wall. However, the blast passes or burns through doorways and other portals into areas on the other side of a wall, and wraps around free-standing surfaces such as columns.
If the surface is touched by any creature before the delay time is up, the stored bolt is discharged automati­cally, with the touching creature taking double the stored damage and all other creatures in the blast area taking half damage.
All victims of both the initial and the stored strikes take half damage on a successful Reflex save.
If a creature is already touching the storage surface when the spell is cast, any stored portion of the bolt dis­charges immediately, with damage calculated as above. If two or more creatures are already touching the storage surface, the spell discharges immediately but the touch­ing creatures and all others in the area take normal damage, as above}}

You grant the ship touched a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to move beneath the surface of the water. You can control the ship's speed and direction as a free action. All interior spaces of the ship remain dry even if a doorway or porthole is open while the ship is underwater. Any creature aboard
the ship when the spell is cast can move about the ship with ease (including climbing and jumping) as if it were afloat on a calm sea. Such creatures can breathe water for the duration of the spell as long as they remain within 10 feet of the ship. External forces, such as a storm or an angry dragon, can still jostle the ship and cause it to shake and possibly knock passengers and objects from it, but nothing falls from the ship as a result of your direction of its movement.
You can transfer control of the ship to another individual by giving that individual the miniature rudder you used as a focus to cast the spell. If the focus is ever lost or becomes unattended, the spell's duration expires.
Once the spell ends (either because the duration expired, the focus was lost or became unattended, or the magic was successfully dispelled), the magic lingers for 1 additional round per caster level. During this time, the ship ascends toward the water's surface at a rate of 60 feet per round. If the ship is still underwater when this additional time runs out, it immediately sinks, and its passengers risk drowning}}

Distant chords of a harsh and terrible symphony&#8212;as if multiple orchestras played different pieces simultaneously&#8212;echo continuously in the air as you reach for your victim.**
A creature targeted by this spell loses the ability to dream during sleep or rest. Rather, in place of dreams, the subject's slumbering mind is filled with the sounds of a discordant orchestra. After the victim's first attempt to sleep, it incurs a -2 penalty on Wisdom-based skill checks. This penalty persists as long as the symphonic nightmare maintains its hold. This spell affects all creatures that sleep or enter sleep-like trances, although creatures without the need to sleep are effectively immune.
In addition, the creature's sleep is now haunted. It can no longer gain complete rest from sleeping or resting. The subject does not regain hit points or heal ability damage naturally, nor is it able to prepare spells if doing so requires a full night's rest.
The creature is, however, now immune to the dream and nightmare spells, as well as to other effects that cause nightmares (such as the night hag's dream haunting ability).
You can lift the effect of this curse at will, but it is otherwise difficult to remove a symphonic nightmare before its duration expires. A remove curse cast at a higher caster level than the symphonic nightmare spell removes it, as does a successful break enchantment. Otherwise, a wish or miracle is required to lift the curse.
This spell can also be cast on a creature you are scrying, or on a creature distant from you if you hold something the creature carried within the past 24 hours}}

Subjects in the area that fail their saves immediately become aware of the condition, but they cannot communicate it due to their paralyzed state (although someone could use a spell such as detect thoughts to ascertain the condition). For every hour the creatures are transfixed before the condition is met, they are allowed another saving throw to break free of the spell's effect.
As long as the spell operates, any Medium or smaller humanoid that enters its area must make a successful saving throw or become transfixed with the same exit conditions (they too become aware of the exit conditions on becoming transfixed). Likewise, any creatures removed from the area are freed from the spell's effect. An affected creature that is attacked gains a new saving throw to break free of the enchantment.

A waterspout moves at a speed of 30 feet. You can concentrate on controlling the waterspout's every movement or specify a simple program, such as move straight ahead, zigzag, circle, or the like. Directing a waterspout's movement or changing its programmed movement is a move action for you. A waterspout always moves during your turn in the initiative order. If the waterspout exceeds the spell's range, it collapses and the spell ends.
A waterspout batters creatures and objects it touches, and it often sucks them up. Any creature or object that comes in contact with it must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d8 points of damage. Medium or smaller creatures that fail their saves are sucked into the spout and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 2d6 points of damage each round (no save). Trapped creatures remain inside for 1d3 rounds before the waterspout ejects them out the top of the spout, and they fall back to the surface (taking 8d6 points of falling damage) 1d8×5 feet from the base of the waterspout.
Waterborne creatures or objects within 10 feet of the spout (below and on all sides) also must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked into the spout if they are Medium or smaller. Anything sucked into the spout takes 3d8 points of damage and is then trapped for 1d3 rounds as described above.
Only the smallest of watercraft, such as canoes, kayaks, or coracles, can be sucked into the spout. The occupant of any such craft can make a Profession (sailor) check instead of a Reflex save if it so chooses to avoid being sucked up}}

Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice, where feasible) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save.

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect.

The purged blood vessels spread outward, creating a many-layered mass of bloody, adhesive tissue that traps nearby creatures in a gory horror.**
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If the attack is successful, the subject loses half its hit points (rounded down) and is stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not stunned. Oozes and plants are not affected by this spell.
The avascular mass instantaneously erupts from the subject and must be anchored to at least two opposed points&#8212;such as floor and ceiling or opposite walls&#8212;or else the mass collapses and has no effect. Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius avascular mass become entangled. The original target of the spell is automatically entangled. Because the avascular mass is magically animate and gradually tightens on those it holds, an entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a DC 25 Concentration check or lose the spell.
Anyone within 20 feet of the primary target when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the avascular mass and is free to act, though moving might be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature can progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
If you have at least 5 feet of avascular mass between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of avascular mass between you, it provides total cover.
The avascular mass of entangling tissue persists for 1 round per caster level. When the duration elapses, the blood vessel mass becomes so much limp, decaying tissue}}

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.
You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell.
For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1.
For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell.
Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant.
Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts.
All binding spells are dismissible.
Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur.
These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.
The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify.
For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.
Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.
If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap.
If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw.
If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.
The binding spell has six versions.
Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.
Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you.
The duration is one year per caster level.
The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.
Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level.
The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age.
This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist.
Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.
Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level.
Reduce the save DC by 2.
Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means.
The effect is permanent.
Reduce the save DC by 3.
Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face.
It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose.
The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities.
The binding is permanent.
The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age.
Reduce the save DC by 4.
Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object.
The binding is permanent.
The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age.
Reduce the save DC by 4.
You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mordenkainen's disjunction affects it normally.
A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect}}

On a successful attack, a living target is engulfed in chill black flames that feed on the fuel of their victim's life force. A creature engulfed in blackfire must make a successful Fortitude save each round that the spell is in effect or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated. A creature that makes its Fortitude save takes no damage for that round and is sickened instead. In addition to its effects on the subject, blackfire can spread rapidly. Each round on its turn, any living creature adjacent to a creature engulfed in blackfire must succeed on a Reflex save or become engulfed itself.
Any creature that has its Constitution reduced to 0 or lower by the spell is turned into a pile of black ash and can be returned to life only by true resurrection or wish, the caster of which must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check to restore the victim to life. If a creature succeeds on its Fortitude save in 3 consecutive rounds, the blackfire affecting it gutters out. The black flames cannot otherwise be extinguished by normal means (such as immersion in water or smothering), but antimagic field, a successful dispel magic, remove curse, or break enchantment snuffs it out.

Second, any creature or object struck by a successful melee attack or melee touch attack with the blackstaff is subject to a dispel magic effect.
This effect works exactly like a targeted dispel magic cast by the creator of the blackstaff.
Third, any spellcaster struck by a successful melee or melee touch attack with the blackstaff loses one prepared spell (or one unused spell slot, for spellcasters who do not prepare spells) of the highest spell level available.
A successful Will save negates the spell loss, but not any damage or dispel effects caused by a strike of the blackstaff.
Blackstaff may be cast upon any nonmagical quarterstaff or on a magic staff in the caster's possession.
If cast on a magic staff, the wielder of the staff must decide as a free action on his turn each round whether he will use the staff's normal abilities or the effects of the blackstaff spell.

For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, you choose one type of energy other than that normally associated with your breath weapon: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You can modify your breath weapon to add an equal amount of the energy you choose. For example, a great wyrm red dragon whose breath weapon normally deals 24d10 points of fire damage could use this spell to produce a cone dealing 24d10 points of fire damage and 24d10 points of acid damage. Even opposed types of energy, such as fire and cold, can be combined using this spell. If you choose sonic energy, the save DC of your breath weapon is reduced by 2.
When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy, it is a spell of that type. For example, breath weapon admixture is an acid spell when you cast it to add acid damage to your breath weapon}}

In Dream, you move through a menagerie of thoughts, desires, and phantoms created by the minds of dreamers everywhere.
For every minute you move through Dream (which is only a single round on the Material Plane), you can &quot;wake&quot; to find yourself five miles displaced in the waking world.
Thus, a character can use this spell to travel rapidly by physically entering where only dreams prowl, moving the desired distance, and stepping back into the waking world.
You know where you will come out in the waking world.
Dream travel can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures who dream, but this requires crossing into the Dreamheart, where you are subject to the vagaries of violent dream realities.
Transferring to another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours on Dream (which corresponds to 1d4&#215;6 minutes as time is measured on most other planes).

This Abyssal heritor feat replaces one feat of the subject's choice that it already possesses.

Season - Possible Weather
Spring - Frequent snowfall, nightly frost
Summer - Light snow, hailstorms, cold rain, cloudy
Autumn - Frequent snowfall, frost
Winter - Frigid cold, blizzard, and constant snowfall
Daily wind and snowfall during a fimbulwinter are determined using the table below.

You assume a visible, incorporeal form like that of a manifesting ghost. You gain the incorporeal subtype for the duration of the spell, providing you with the following abilities and characteristics.
You have no physical body while in this state. You can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. You are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells, including touch spells, or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a  corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). Nondamaging spell effects affect you normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (such as **implosion**) or they create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (such as a **web** or **wall of stone** spell). 
Your attacks while in **ghostform** pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as **mage armor**) work normally against you. Nonmagical attacks you make with a melee weapon have no effect on corporeal targets, and any melee attack you make with a magic weapon against a corporeal target has a 50% miss chance, except for attacks you make with a ghost touch weapon, which are made normally (no miss chance). Spells you cast while in **ghostform** affect corporeal targets normally, including spells that require you to make an attack roll (such as rays or melee touch spells). 
Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is also incorporeal as long as it remains in your possession. An object that you relinquish loses its incorporeal quality (and you lose the ability to manipulate the object). If you use a thrown weapon or a ranged weapon, the projectile becomes corporeal as soon as it is fired and can affect  a corporeal target normally (no miss chance). Magic items you possess work normally with respect to their effects on you or on another target.
As an incorporeal creature, you have no natural armor bonus but have a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if your Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus). 
You can enter or pass through solid objects while in **ghostform**, but you must remain adjacent to the object's exterior, and so you cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than your own. You can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to your current location, but enemies have total concealment from you while you are inside an object. In order to see farther from the object you are in and attack normally, you must emerge. While inside an object, you have total cover, but when you attack a creature outside the object you have cover only, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at you as you attack. You cannot pass through a force effect. 
You can pass through and operate in water as easily as you do in air. You cannot fall or take falling damage. You cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can you be tripped or grappled. In fact, you cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are you subject to such actions. You have no weight while in **ghostform** and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.
You move silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if you don't wish to be while in **ghostform**. You have no Strength score while incorporeal, so your Dexterity modifier applies to both your melee attacks and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to you. You have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when you cannot see}}

The construct's body becomes covered in a thin skin of clay, flesh, iron, or stone (depending on the type of golem immunity chosen), and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the construct, depending on the type of golem immunity conferred by the spell.
<strong>Clay:</strong> A move earth spell drives the construct back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it. A disintegrate spell slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage. An earthquake spell cast directly at the construct stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage. The construct gets no saving throw against any of these effects.
Any magical attack against the construct that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage.
<strong>Flesh:</strong> A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.
<strong>Iron:</strong> A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against fire effects. The construct is affected as an iron construct by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell, regardless of its original composition.
<strong>Stone:</strong> A transmute rock to mud spell slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock acts as a <a href="/spells/eberron-campaign-setting--12/total-repair--4814/">**total repair**</a> spell. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the construct's structure but negates its immunity to magic for 1 full round}}

Your living heart can be stored or hidden anywhere you like, where it continues to beat for the duration of the spell. While under the effect of heart of stone, you gain damage reduction 5/- and resistance to cold 5, fire 5, and electricity 5, but are subject to the following disadvantages. Your rate of natural healing slows to only 1 hit point per day (regardless of character level or whether you rest). In addition, your own living heart is susceptible to attack; if it is damaged or destroyed, you are instantly slain.
Heart of stone can be dispelled, in which case your living heart instantly returns to its proper place while the stone heart is transported to the place where you left your heart. Your heart and the stone heart likewise switch places if you enter an antimagic field (temporarily negating the spell's effects), but the spell resumes when you leave it. Stone to flesh can also end the spell, though you get a Fortitude saving throw to resist}}

It has damage reduction 15/magic and bludgeoning and is immune to cold, poison, critical hits, and magical effects that don't deal damage.
It takes half again as much damage (+50%) from fire.
An icy claw never provokes attacks of opportunity.
It cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field, but it is affected by prismatic wall or prismatic sphere.
A disintegrate spell or a successful dispel magic destroys it.
An icy claw attacks an opponent of your choice once per round, and its attack bonus equals your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for a wizard or sorcerer, respectively) +10 for the claw's Strength score (31).
An icy claw deals 1d6+15 points of damage plus 3d6 points of cold damage.
If it successfully damages a Medium or smaller foe, it attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, with a grapple check bonus equal to your caster level +10.
On a successful grapple check, an icy claw deals normal damage (see above).
The claw ignores effects intended to mask or conceal the selected target, including darkness, invisibility, displacement, hiding in plain sight, and the like.
Directing an icy claw to a new target is a free action}}

You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.
Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.
Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone.

For example, a 13th-level cleric would normally deal 65 points of damage to an undead creature. However, if that creature had only 48 hit points remaining, the caster would gain only 48 hit points (even as the target was destroyed). These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. A successful Will save halves the damage dealt and the hit points gained.

This hysteria affects subjects as though they were nauseated; they are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention.

(This confusion occurs whether or not the spell successfully affects you). A successful Will save (DC 18 + your Int modifier) negates this effect and renders that foe immune to this casting of the spell.
Furthermore, while mind of the labyrinth is active, you can use an immediate action to activate a dominate person effect (as the spell, except that the duration is 1 hour) on one humanoid who casts a mind-affecting spell on you.

A caravel is a fairly small, double-decked sailing ship (see page 98 for more information).
It holds a generous amount of cargo and offers cramped quarters for crew and passengers.
The ship produced by this spell has even more room for cargo and passengers, contained within an extradimensional space.
The entry point to this space is a hatch on the aft upper deck.
Lifting the hatch reveals a set of wooden stairs, which descend about 6 feet to a horizontal shimmering in the air about 4 feet wide.
Only those you designate can enter this space, and the extradimensional portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter.
Those without authorization to enter instead continue descending the steps to an ordinary cargo hold.
You can open the portal again from your own side at will.
Those who pass beyond the portal's entrance find themselves in a magnificent foyer with many staterooms whose doors open from this space.
The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
You can create any deck plan you desire within the limit of the spell's effect.
The cabins are furnished, and the galley contains sufficient foodstuffs and preparation equipment to serve three full meals per day per person per caster level.
A staff of near-transparent pursers (up to two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter.
They function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere within the extradimensional space.
Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the passenger space, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.
Bad weather or other marine hazards can still threaten the vessel, but even if it sinks, the passenger space remains safe and isolated (though exiting it might prove difficult).
The ship is crewed by a minimum complement of spectral deckhands, which perform the basic tasks of maintenance.
These, like the cabin servants, behave as unseen servants but can travel anywhere on board ship and can enter the extradimensional space if you so direct.
The spectral deckhands respond to the direction of the helmsman, reducing the number of crew necessary to control the caravel to 1.
If you do not provide a real helmsman, the ship will steer itself on the last course a living helmsman provided but will not be able to avoid collisions or hazards or adjust to changing conditions}}

This spell creates a field around you that deflects physical blows.
The field affects melee and ranged attacks made with natural or manufactured weapons, but not spells or magical attacks unless they are delivered with a physical touch attack.
Anyone who aims a melee or ranged attack against you must make a Will save to overcome the spell's effect.
If the save fails, all attacks that individual makes against you while the spell lasts have a 50% chance to be deflected to another target instead.
Spell resistance applies to this effect.
If a melee attack is deflected, the new target must be a creature both adjacent to you and within your attacker's melee reach.
If a ranged attack is deflected, the new target must be both adjacent to you and within your attacker's range.
If more than one target is available, determine which creature is attacked randomly.
Any combat modifiers (such as cover) apply to the attack.
A creature that has total cover against the attacker can't be selected as a target, nor can the attacker.
If no eligible target exists, the attack misses.
As an immediate action while the spell lasts, you can choose to redirect a deflected attack back at the attacker.
You can wait to make this decision until after you know an attack has been deflected, but you must do so before you know which creature is the target of the deflected attack.
Using this ability ends the spell's duration}}

Anything contained within an Otiluke's telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight.
You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less.
The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents.
You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere.
You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell.
If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round.
If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the spell's duration expires, or you begin concentrating again.
If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration.
The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.
You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.

The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state.
The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines.
Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form.
If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.
Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature.
For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and then grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death.
If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed.
Perhaps you could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide.
In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM must adjudicate many of these situations.
A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell.
Magic items aren't affected by this spell.
This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine.
It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.
This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of baleful polymorph, polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute metal to wood, or transmute rock to mud.

A prismatic bow functions as a +1 longbow; in addition, once per round you can choose to imbue an arrow shot from it with one of the seven colors of the bow, chosen from the list of colors created by prismatic spray (PH 264).
In addition to its normal effect, the arrow has the same effect as the corresponding beam from prismatic spray (including blindness for 2d4 rounds if the target has 8 HD or fewer).
Saves and spell resistance apply to this effect as normal for prismatic spray.
Once you fire an arrow, the corresponding color disappears from the bow, and you can't select that color again during this particular casting of the spell.
When the duration ends or when you have used the effects of all seven colors, the bow vanishes.
You are automatically considered proficient with a prismatic bow.
No one else can use your prismatic bow, though you need not carry it at all times (you can stow it, drop it, or even hand it to another character to hold).
If you cast this spell a second time while a previous version is still in effect, the first prismatic bows duration ends}}

The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall.
The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.
Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.
The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a Mordenkainen's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.
Prismatic wall can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area.
The illusion created must be stated in general terms.
Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game.
You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area.
You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible.
Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.
Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed.
Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created.
A band of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance.
Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen.
Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another.
Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion}}

Each round the caster concentrates, she deals 1 point of ability score drain to the subject.
Although the caster can choose which ability score to drain, she must choose a different ability score to drain in each round and cannot choose a score already drained until she has drained all the others equally, at which point the process starts over.
Thus, if the caster drains 1 point of Strength, she must choose another ability in the next round and cannot choose Strength again until she has drained 1 point each of Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
Then, the caster can drain a second point of Strength (or any other ability), but not a third until she has drained a second point from all the other ability scores.
If the caster casts this spell on the night of a full moon, she becomes effectively one week younger for every point she drains.
(Her age is reduced, but memories and abilities acquired during that week are not lost).
Otherwise, the subject takes the ability score drain, but the caster gains nothing.
The subject withers and shrivels as the caster drains its ability scores.
When the subject's Constitution score reaches 0, the subject becomes a horrid, dry husk and cannot be further drained.
If the caster dies while concentrating on this spell, all the subject's lost ability score points are immediately regained.

Two new symbols are described below; the others appear in the symbol spell description in the Player's Handbook.
Death Symbol of Bane: This type of symbol was created by the worshipers of Bane and lost until that dark deity was reborn in 1372 DR.
A death symbol of Bane is always carefully engraved and never quickly scribed.
It is triggered as you designate, within the guidelines of the symbol spell.
However, a person wearing a holy symbol of Bane never triggers the spell.
A death symbol of Bane functions exactly like a symbol of death,
except that any creatures within 60 feet of the death symbol of Bane that survive must make two more Fortitude saves, the first to avoid taking 1d12 points of cold damage and the second to avoid the effects of a doom spell.
This version of the symbol spell has the death and evil descriptors.
Material Component: A paste made from the symbol spell's material components and the blood of intelligent sacrificed creatures (minimum 3 Intelligence) whose Hit Dice total at least 30 that have been killed within the past year.
Once a creature's blood is used for this spell, that same creature's blood cannot be used in the material component for another death symbol of Bane.
Symbol of Spell Loss: This is another variant of the symbol spell.
When triggered, the symbol of spell loss begins to attack the minds of spellcasters within 60 feet.
Each caster must attempt a Will saving throw every round he or she is in this area.
Failure means that the highest-level spell prepared by the spellcaster (or highest-level spell slot, if the character casts spells like a sorcerer or bard) is lost.
The symbol remains until it has erased 30 levels of spells.
The symbol attacks creatures with spell-like abilities as if they had spells.
It has no effect on creatures without spells or spell-like abilities.
This version of the symbol spell is a mind-affecting spell}}

When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150.
The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.
Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first.
Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.
A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.
Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).
To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.
Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.
As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.
Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).
Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.
In this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.
Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.
You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.
Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.
These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.
Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.
For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.
Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.
If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.
Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.
Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.
Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.
Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.
You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.
Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.
An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.
Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.
Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death}}

The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform.
If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed.
Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.
Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject.
This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect.
If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2.
If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.
Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap.
To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled.
A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object.
As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save}}

Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed.
Once the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level. For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take. For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chance
to be affected.
For example, you have three spell levels of absorption remaining and are struck by dominate person cast as a 5th-level spell. Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. If affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you're struck by disintegrate cast as a 6th-level spell with four levels of absorption remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (1/3) of the damage you would normally take from the spell.
You can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don't disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used). The levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell}}

Throughout the spell's duration, any conjuration spells with the evil descriptor that are cast within 60 feet of the rift function at caster level +2.
You cannot make the rift open beneath a fixed structure such as a tower, castle wall, or Daern's instant fortress.
However, you can make it open underneath a wagon, tent, or similarly mobile object or lightweight structure.
Untended objects wholly or partly in squares occupied by the rift fall in, taking 6d6 points of damage from the fall.
Any creature standing wholly or partly in the area where the rift opens must succeed on a Reflex saving throw or fall into it as well, taking a like amount of damage.
A successful save indicates that the creature avoids falling in by moving to the nearest safe square(s).
Anything that falls into the rift is scorched by black fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage per round and 6d6 points of divine energy damage per round.
Energy resistance or immunity does not protect against the divine energy damage.
On the second and third rounds of the spell's duration, black fire continues to fill the rift.
In addition, the rift sprouts black fiery tentacles that reach out to all creatures within 60 feet of the rift's edge.
Such creatures are entitled to a Reflex save each round to avoid the fiery tendrils; a creature that fails its save is lashed for 3d6 points of fire damage and 3d6 points of divine energy damage.
At the end of the spell's duration, the rift closes.
Anything still trapped inside the rift when it closes plane shifts (as the spell) to a random layer of the Abyss.

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.
These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times.
If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation.
The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.
Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will.
To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord.
If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically.
Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).
When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely.
Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them.
The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you)}}

The chain creates an oscillating ring surrounding the target at a distance of 5 feet (so all squares adjacent to the target creature are within the chain).
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the chain fails to encircle it and dissipates harmlessly.
Otherwise, the chain surrounds the target, with the following effects: The target creature cannot leave the area defined by the chain.
Other creatures can enter or leave the area (although they must succeed on a DC 15 Escape Artist check or a DC 15 Tumble check to slip past the chain).
If the target was in midair (flying, levitating, and so on) when the chain took effect, the chain suspends the target in midair safely as if it had a solid floor on which to stand.
The chain prevents the target from changing form, including lycanthropic form changes, vampiric transformations, or polymorph or similar effects.
The chain acts as a dimensional anchor upon the target.
The chain deals 2d6 points of force damage per round to the target.
No magic functions within the chain, as if the chain defined the area of an antimagic field.

Its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively).
Anything hit by the blade is disintegrated if it fails a Fortitude save, taking 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6), or 5d6 points of damage if the saving throw is successful.

When casting Elminster's evasion, you must specify the locale and detail up to six specific conditions that trigger the spell.
When any of these situations occurs, your body, mind, and soul are whisked away to the location.
The location can be any place you have visited, even on another plane.
Also when casting the spell, you cast teleport without error and one or two other spells that are to take effect when you arrive at your destination.
The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for all castings.
If the companion spells have combined casting times longer than 10 minutes, use the combined casting times instead.
The teleport without error spell whisks you through the Astral Plane to your destination, so anything that prevents astral travel also foils Elminster's evasion.
The spells to be brought into effect by the evasion must be ones that affect your person (feather fall, levitate, fly, teleport, and so on) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third of your caster level (maximum 6th level).
The conditions you specify to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general (see the contingency spell, in Chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook).
The spell pulls together your mind, body, and soul if they have been separated.
For example, if your soul is trapped in a magic jar when the evasion is triggered, your soul returns to your body.
(This breaks the magic jar spell).
If your body or soul has been magically trapped (for example with a binding, imprisonment, or trap the soul spell),
you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the person who cast the trapping spell).
If you succeed, the trapping spell is broken and the evasion works.
If you fail, the evasion fails.
If you're dead when you arrive at your destination, your soul immediately departs just as though you died at your destination.

Ensul's soultheft lasts for 1 round per level, during which time you can attempt touch attacks as often as once per round.
Some users of this spell arrange for the victim to be restrained or otherwise helpless, so that they can be easily drained for multiple rounds.

You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.
Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.

Air within the area freezes, resulting in a heavy snowstorm lasting for the duration of the spell.
Snow accumulates only if the ground temperature is below the moderate band.
Living creatures caught within the area when the spell is cast instantly turn to ice (as per the flesh to ice spell).
If a creature successfully saves, frostfell deals 1d6 points of frostburn damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
Creatures entering the area after the spell has been cast do not take this damage; however, all creatures in the area are subject to the normal effects of cold, snow, and ice for the duration of the spell.
Objects in the area, including those held by creatures, are instantly covered in a thin layer of frost, making them slippery.
When a creature uses a frosted item (a weapon, lockpicks, a potion, and so on), it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check or it drops the item before it can be used.
Cold spells cast within the area gain a +1 caster level.
Multiple frostfells may be cast in the same area to increase the effects (dropping the temperature by an additional 3 bands).

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the **gate**. The **gate** itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
A **gate** has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the **gate** from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
**Planar Travel:** As a mode of planar travel, a **gate** spell functions much like a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/plane-shift--2423/">**plane shift**</a> spell, except that the **gate** opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a **gate** from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you&#8212;anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A **gate** cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
You could position a **gate** in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.
You may hold the **gate** open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.
**Calling Creatures:** The second effect of the **gate** spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the **gate** to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the **gate**, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a **gate** that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).
If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual&#8212;for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin&#8212;you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.
A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.
If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in &quot;livestock&quot; rather than in coin, which could involve complications). Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.
Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.
**Note:** When you use a calling spell such as **gate** to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, **gate** is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon}}

Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes.

When you cast the spell, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane.
At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1 foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter.
You determine the environment within the demiplane when you first cast genesis, reflecting most any desire you can visualize.
You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain.
This spell cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth).

It fades swiftly, but you can now feel a presence, as though the environment itself watched you.
With this spell, you grant the particular building or location a permanent &quot;guardian spirit&quot;.
You must task the spirit with a specific purpose, and that purpose must in some manner involve protecting the building or region to which it is attached.
The task can be very general (&quot;Slay any creature who attempts to enter!&quot;) or far more specific (&quot;Kill any goblin who tries to take the red sword down off the wall&quot;).
The task can't be so specific as to mention the names of individual creatures, or to require unseen knowledge such as alignments or allegiances.
Finally, it must be simple enough to clearly convey in one or two sentences.
If the triggering event occurs, the genius loci manifests exactly where you cast the spell, taking the form of an elder elemental (choose air, earth, fire, or water when you cast the spell).
It immediately attempts to carry out the designated task.
Once the spell is complete, you have no special control over the spirit's actions, and if you trigger the manifestation, it attacks you just as it would anyone else.
The manifested spirit behaves in all ways as a normal elemental of its kind, within the parameters of the task assigned.
If the spirit's manifested form is slain, it is not destroyed and the spell is not broken.
However, it can't manifest for 24 hours after being destroyed.
The only way to permanently break a genius loci spell is with a miracle,Mordenkainen's disjunction, or wish, or else to permanently defeat the guardian spirit's purpose.
If, for instance, the spirit was commanded to prevent a particular item from being destroyed, the destruction of that item renders its existence moot.
When not actively involved in protecting its territory or following its task, the spirit shows no sign of its existence.
When it manifests, the creature appears to come out of nowhere.
Anyone viewing the building or area with detect magic sees an overwhelming aura of conjuration; true seeing reveals the spirit wandering its territory, appearing as a vague, hazy silhouette of the creature it manifests as.
Genius loci becomes a spell of the same type as the elemental manifestation specified (air, earth, fire, or water)}}

If cast in an area adjoining or overlapping another teleport cage, the effects of both spells merge to create a single teleport cage.
Undermountain, the greatest dungeon of Faerûn, is believed to have been enclosed within the largest teleport cage in existence in the Realms by means of this effect.
When cast within a teleport cage, such translocation spells simply transport all affected creatures and objects to another random location within the teleport cage.
For example, if a wizard casts teleport within the confines of Undermountain, the encompassing teleport cage would cause him to appear at another random location within the great dungeon.
When a caster outside the area encompassed by a teleport cage attempts to teleport into it, this spell redirects their destination to another random location reachable by the spell.
For example, if a 9th-level wizard in Waterdeep attempted to teleport into the depths of Undermountain, the teleport cage would cause him to appear at another random location within 900 miles of the place where he cast the spell.

**Years:** You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one year per caster level. You notice only noteworthy events such as deaths, battles, scenes of great emotion, important discoveries, and significant happenings.
**Centuries:** You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one century plus an additional century for every four caster levels beyond 1st. For instance, a 16th-level caster would gain insight into the events of four centuries in the past, and a 17th-level caster would see back across five centuries. You notice only the most remarkable of events: coronations, deaths of important personages, major battles, and other truly historic happenings}}

Developed by powerful frost mages who have more than their fair share of enemies to fight, an ice assassin is an effective way to destroy an enemy without putting yourself at risk.
An ice assassin spell creates a living, breathing creature that is a near-perfect duplicate of an existing creature.
The duplicate is formed entirely out of ice, but once the spell is in effect, it appears as an exact duplicate to all but its source, who always sees the ice assassin as an animated ice statue of himself.
The ice assassin possesses all the skills, abilities, and memories possessed by the original, but its personality is warped and twisted by an all-consuming need to slay the original.
It also constantly uses locate creature on its duplicate at a caster level equal to your own.
If its quarry is outside the range of this effect, the ice assassin must rely on its own cleverness or advice from you to track the original.
The ice assassin has the cold subtype.
Creatures familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Spot check.
You must make a Disguise check (gaining a +10 circumstance bonus from the power of the spell) when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is.
The ice assassin is under your absolute command.
You possess a telepathic link to the ice assassin, and when you concentrate, you receive a clear image of the area surrounding the ice assassin as if you were scrying it.
Further, you can have any spell you cast on yourself affect the ice assassin as well; this includes spells with a target of &quot;You&quot; only.
These benefits persist as long as you and the ice assassin remain within a mile of each other.
If the ice assassin travels beyond this range, it continues to function and seek out its nemesis, but you have no direct control over it.
An ice assassin has no ability to become more powerful; it cannot increase its level or abilities.
Damage caused to the ice assassin can be repaired only via a complex process requiring 1 day, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped laboratory.
If the ice assassin is reduced to 0 hit points by any damage except for fire damage, it explodes into a burst of icy shrapnel in a 20-foot radius that causes 1d6 points of cold damage for every two caster levels you possess; a successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage.
An ice assassin slain by fire damage simply melts into a pool of water}}

Its unarmed natural attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
In addition, the subject can breathe a 30-foot cone of hellfire that deals 8d10 points damage.
This damage is not fire damage, and is not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy (fire), fire shield (chill shield),

All creatures in the area are entitled to a Reflex save against the spell's DC for half damage.
The subject must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of this breath weapon.
The subject also gains resistance to fire 20.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the chain devil).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.

You infuse a creature with the terrifying power of a pit fiend.
The spell causes the subject's mouth to expand to accommodate new dripping fangs.
To add to this devilish effect, a pair of red leathery wings tears free from the flesh of the subject's back, granting it a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability.
The subject of the spell gains these benefits regardless of his aspect choice (see below).
The power granted to the subject by investiture of the pit fiend can manifest in one of three ways.
At the beginning of each round, the invested creature chooses which aspect of the spell will be in place.
Aspect of Tyranny: The invested creature's hands lengthen to horrific claws, and the creature gains powerful melee attacks.
While the aspect of tyranny is in effect, the invested creature can attack with both its claws and wings.
Each attack deals base damage of 2d6 points.
The claws are treated as primary melee attacks with a natural weapon, and the wing attacks are treated as secondary attacks with a natural weapon.
When making attacks with these claws and wings, the invested creature has a base attack bonus equal to its character level (or Hit Dice, if the invested creature has a level adjustment).
When taking a full attack action and using only the natural weapons granted by the aspect of tyranny, the secondary attacks are made with only a -2 penalty rather than the normal -5.
Because these are natural attacks, the invested creature cannot make multiple attacks because of a high base attack bonus.
Aspect of Pestilence:When the invested creature chooses to manifest the aspect of pestilence, it can, as a standard action, release a cloud of disease-ridden air.
Creatures within 10 feet of the subject when it generates this effect must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw against the spell's DC or take 2 points of Strength damage.
Aspect of Terror:When the invested creature chooses to manifest the aspect of terror, it can, as a standard action, release a powerful wave of fear.
Creatures within 10 feet of the subject when it generates this effect must succeed on a Will saving throw against the spell's DC or become frightened for 2 rounds.
This wave of fear is a mind-affecting fear effect.
The subject gains immunity to poison and resistance to fire 20.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the pit fiend).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute}}

Mystra's symbol appears drawn in silver on each palm (or on the chest and forehead of beings lacking palms) as a glowing brand equal that sheds light as a candle.
A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or wizard, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw.
Any time the target casts a spell, he gains a number of negative levels equal to the level of the spell being cast.
(The spell he just cast functions normally at the caster level he possessed before he received the negative levels for casting that spell).
This effect is cumulative and lasts as long as the crowning touch lasts.
There is no saving throw to avoid gaining the negative levels, but 24 hours after gaining each negative level, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = crowning touch's spell save) for each negative level.
If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed.
With each spell use, streaks of silver appear in the hair of the target, until the transgressor's hair is all silver (which happens when the character's level reaches 1st).
The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a wish spell or a successful break enchantment spell (caster level check DC 15 + caster level of the crowning touch).
After the curse is lifted, all the effects (except permanent level loss) go away.
This spell was developed for use only against beings who misuse the sort of magic Mystra has dominion over.
The Lady of Mysteries does not look kindly on mages who hurl deadly magic at every spellcaster who insults them.

When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select.
The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.
If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor.
Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and receives no saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below).
If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space.
You may aim more than one meteor at the same target.
Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each.
(Fire resistance applies to each sphere's damage individually)}}

When the node's diameter reaches the low end of the range for the next higher class (see Table 5-1 on page 96), its class increases by +1.

An obedient avalanche spell affects creatures differently, depending on where they are in relation to the avalanche.
<strong>Within 20 feet of the Center Point:</strong> Creatures take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8) and an additional 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels. A successful Reflex save halves the damage. Creatures who fail their saves are also buried (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 90). All squares within 20 feet of the center point are covered in heavy snow (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would. A buried creature can free itself with a DC 20 Strength check as a full-round action, and can be dug free by others (a single creature working alone requires 1 minute to free a trapped creature). A trapped creature is unable to move, and cannot cast spells with somatic components, and any material components must be in hand.
<strong>Between 20 feet and 40 feet of the Center Point:</strong> Creatures take half as much damage from the impact of the avalanche as the creatures nearer the center point took (Reflex negates). Creatures who fail their saves must also resist the force of the snow moving past them as if they were being bull rushed. The snow has a +13 attack bonus (+5 for effective Strength of 20 and +8 for effectively being Huge) on the bull rush check, and it pushes characters away from the center point of the spell. All squares in the 20-foot to 40-foot ring are covered in snow (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would.
<strong>Terrain and Structures:</strong> The avalanche uproots small trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of light rubble (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 91) even after the snow melts. Structures struck by an obedient avalanche take 1d6×10 points of damage.
An obedient avalanche extinguishes all flames it touches, whether they are normal or magical}}

Regardless of the specific numbers or kinds of undead created with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead with this spell than four times your caster level with a single casting of plague of undead.
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell or animate dead (PH 198), however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. The limit imposed by this spell and the animate dead spell are the same, meaning that creatures you animate with either spell count against this limit.

You see the target's memories like stories and know that you can rewrite them as a master bard rewrites the inferior works of his apprentices.**
You can selectively destroy, alter, or implant memories in the subject creature as you see fit. Casting the spell gives you access to all of the subject's thoughts and memories, allowing you to implement as many of the following specific effects as you like.
<strong>Memory Erasure:</strong> Memories possessed by the subject can be erased, including knowledge of specific events, people, or places. You can erase up to one full week of memories from the subject's mind.
<strong>Memory Implant:</strong> You can create false memories in the subject's mind as you see fit. You can implant memories of being friends with a hated enemy, events that didn't really take place, or betrayals by people the subject regards as friends.
<strong>Negative Levels:</strong> You can bestow a number of negative levels equal to 1/2 the subject's character level (rounding down, minimum 1st level) or less. This effect represents erasure of class knowledge and training. These negative levels never become permanent level loss, but they cannot be removed by spells such as restoration, instead returning at a rate of one level per day.
<strong>Persona Rebuilding:</strong> By erasing the subject's previous personality and implanting a false set of memories, you can build a new persona for the creature, altering its alignment, beliefs, values, and personality traits. (Some class abilities might be affected by alignment changes.)
<strong>Programmed Trigger:</strong> You can program the subject to delay the onset of any of the above effects until a specific event takes place, such as the receipt of a coded message, capture by enemies, or arrival at some destination. Similarly, you could specify some or all of the alterations you create in a subject to be removed by a specific event.
The nature of programmed amnesia is such that a subject given new memories (whether willing or not) might be given cause to suspect that those memories are false, based on how complete your programming is. For example, a paladin subject to a persona rebuilding effect that changes her alignment to neutral loses her paladin abilities. Unless you impart a specific believable memory of why she changed alignment, the character will perceive this unexplained gap in her memory and might take steps (such as seeking a magical cure for her &quot;amnesia&quot;) that could negate the spell's effect (see below).
Generally, your subject must be either willing to undergo the spell or restrained in some way so that it cannot leave or interfere with the casting. Programmed amnesia cannot be dispelled, and so is normally permanent unless you care to specify events that will end the effect. Its effect can also be removed by a greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell}}

You tear a temporary hole in reality itself that sucks all loose material and living creatures into it, sending them to a random plane (see sidebar). Everything sucked into the reality maelstrom goes to the same plane.
Reality maelstrom has a primary area and a secondary area. The primary area is the hole itself: a sphere with a 20-foot radius centered on the spell's point of origin. Within that area, all unattended objects weighing 100 pounds or less are sucked into the maelstrom, as are all individuals who fail a Will saving throw.
The rip also creates a windstorm of air that affects objects and creatures in the secondary area of the spell. The secondary area is all the space farther than 20 feet from the spell's point of origin but not farther than 40 feet away. All unattended objects within the secondary area that weigh 50 pounds or less are drawn into the primary area of the maelstrom. Individuals within the secondary area must make a Reflex saving throw. Those who fail are sucked into the primary area and must then make a Will saving throw to avoid being drawn into the maelstrom.
Individuals who succeed on either saving throw can move and attack as normal.
A reality maelstrom is a one-way portal, so nothing ever emerges from the hole the spell makes.

Reaving Dispel(Spell Compendium): - Sorcerer(9)

Your body shakes uncontrollably, as if eagerly anticipating the power behind those spells.**
This spell functions like <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dispel-magic--2315/">**dispel magic**</a> (PH 223), except that your caster level for your dispel check is a maximum of +20 instead of +10, and (as with greater dispel magic) you have a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. When casting a targeted dispel or counterspell, you can choose to reave each spell you successfully dispel, stealing its power and effect for yourself. When making a targeted dispel, make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the target spell or each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target creature or object. 
Each spell you dispel with a targeted dispel can be reaved if you so desire, and the spell's effects are redirected to you, continuing as if cast on you by the original caster with no interruption to or extension of duration. Once you reave the spell, you identify it if you haven't done so already (see below). If the subject was the caster and the spell is dismissible, you can dismiss it as if you had cast it yourself. Likewise, if the subject was the caster and the spell requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect as if you had cast it yourself.
You can still attempt to reave a spell you didn't identify with your Spellcraft check, but doing so can be risky if you don't know the specifics of the spell's effect. For example, if you fail to identity an ongoing spell effect on an enemy character and choose to reave anyway, you might find yourself under the influence of the dominate person effect that character was suffering from. Any spell resistance you might have has no effect against harmful spells you might inadvertently reave, but you get the same chance to save against those spell effects as the original target.
If you choose to reave a spell you have successfully counterspelled with reaving dispel, you seize control of the spell after the enemy caster completes it, and you can redirect the spell to whatever targets or area you wish (including the original caster, if appropriate). Again, you must make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the spell you intend to reave, but you are free to choose to redirect a spell whose effect, range, and area you don't know. If the redirected spell's correct casting conditions aren't met (because you guess at an improper target or range, for example), the spell fails.
Reaving dispel can be used to cast an area dispel with the increased maximum caster level, but any magical effects so dispelled cannot be reaved}}

To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action).
When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode.
No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar that is touching the subject).

Aid: You can boost the effectiveness of an ally's spell by applying any one metamagic feat from the following list: Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Maximize Spell, or Widen Spell.
To use this option, you must expend a spell slot (or sacrifice a prepared spell) whose spell level equals or exceeds that of the ally's spell with the desired metamagic feat applied.
For example, empowering an ally's fireball would require you to expend a 5th-level or higher spell slot.
Manipulate: You can seize control of the spell's range, area, or targets, as appropriate, and reshape these factors as you choose.
For example, you could cause an enemy wizard's fireball to explode at his feet, or you could cause his haste spell to target your allies within the area he has specified.
Only one property of the spell, chosen from among those that the caster can normally designate, can be manipulated in this manner.
For example, you could not choose the targets of a sleep spell because the targets affected are determined by the spell itself, not the caster.
Backlash: You counter the spell as normal, but your opponent must succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds}}

Superior invisibility renders the recipient immune to detection by see invisibility, faerie fire, glitterdust, invisibility purge, dust of appearance, and the blindsense ability, though creatures under the effect of the spell can be detected by true seeing or the blindsight ability.

The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice.

Teleportation circle can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.

Upon completion of the spell, the tidal wave forms and moves from the starting point you designate in the direction you specify at a speed of 150 feet per round for the duration of the spell, or until it strikes land.
Any creature swimming in the water as the tidal wave hits it must make a DC 30 Swim check each round to remain afloat.
Creatures that succeed are washed forward by the tidal wave and must continue to make Swim checks each round.
Creatures that fail the check are sucked beneath the tidal wave and forced 8d10 feet below the surface of the water, taking 4d6 points of nonlethal damage.
The wave passes over submerged creatures, which are subject to drowning (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Any Medium or smaller ship caught in the path of the tidal wave takes 6d10 points of damage, while larger ships take an additional 6d10 points of damage per size category they are larger than Medium.
Furthermore, the ship is carried along by the tidal wave for a number of feet equal to the number of points of damage taken x5.
For example, a sailing ship that takes 66 points of damage is carried in the surge of the wave for 330 feet.
If the movement of the ship results in a collision with another ship or with land, the ship takes additional damage (see below).
Any creatures and equipment aboard the ship that are not lashed down are swept off the decks and into the sea (and creatures are then subject to the Swim checks noted above).
If a tidal wave drives up onto shore, it deals 6d10 points of damage to everything in its path within 200 feet of the shore, 3d10 points of damage to everything farther than 200 feet but within 400 feet of the shore, and 1d10 points of damage to everything farther than 400 feet but within 1,000 feet of shore.
Any ships in port or washed ahead of the tidal wave take 6d10 points of damage in addition to any taken for being struck by the wave (see above) and end up 5d10-10 feet inland when they come to rest}}

You transform natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of red-hot molten lava. All creatures in the spell's area that make successful Reflex saves take 6d6 points of fire damage, provided they can physically escape the area on their next turn. Creatures that fail their saves, or those unable to escape the area, take 20d6 points of fire damage in each round they remain in the area. Creatures in the lava have their speed reduced to 5 feet and take a &#8212;2 penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class. Even after leaving the area of the spell, creatures that were exposed to the lava take half damage (either 3d6 or 10d6) for 1 additional round.
If transmute rock to lava is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the lava falls to the floor and spreads out in a 15-foot-radius pool at a depth of approximately 1-1/2 feet. The rain of lava deals 2d6 points of fire damage to anyone caught directly beneath (Reflex half). In addition, creatures take 10d6 points of fire damage each round when they are caught in the area of the pool.
Although constructions of worked stone can't be targeted with this spell, casting it on unworked stone below or adjacent to such structures deals 10d6 points of fire damage per round to any part of the structure in contact with the lava. Wooden structures in contact with lava instantly burst into flame.
The lava cools naturally from its surface toward its center, and it no longer deals fire damage after 2d6 hours as it slowly reverts to stone. Though a 15-foot-radius pool can take as long as two days to completely cool, the core of a 10-foot cube of lava might remain molten for a month or more.
Magical or enchanted stone is not affected by the spell}}

An unbinding spell negates charm and hold spells of all types; arcane locks and similar closures; and spells that create physical or magical barriers, such as wall of fire, wall of force, guards and wards, temporal stasis, and slow spells, among others. The effect of a statue spell is also ended, and a magic jar is shattered&#8212;forever destroyed&#8212;and the life force within snuffed out. In addition, any spell that holds magical effects, including other spells (magic mouth, imbue with spell ability, and so on), immediately releases them at a range of 0 feet.
Protective spells such as protection from evil, shield, globe of invulnerability, and similar spells are not affected by an unbinding. Petrified creatures are neither revealed nor restored. Individuals bound to service are not freed (including creatures such asfamiliars, invisible stalkers, genies, and elementals). An antimagic field is not affected, nor does the effect of unbinding penetrate one. A magic circle against evil (or another alignment) that currently holds a creature imprisoned is dispelled. 
Curses and geas/quest spells are negated only if you are of a level equal to or greater than that of the original caster.
All these effects occur without regard to the caster's wishes. Spell effects on the person of the caster, or effects or items being carried or worn by the caster, remain undisturbed, but any others within the area are affected, including those of allies.

Furthermore, evil-aligned creatures can see in this darkness as if it were simply a dimly lighted area.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even **wish**, however, has its limits.
A **wish** can produce any one of the following effects.
<ul><li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li><li>Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li><li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li><li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li><li>Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as **geas/quest** or **insanity**.</li><li>Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li><li>Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.</li><li>Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five **wish** spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li><li>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single **wish** can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same **wish**. A **wish** can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</li><li>Revive the dead. A **wish** can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A **wish** can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two **wish**, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A **wish** cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.</li><li>Transport travelers. A **wish** can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li><li>Undo misfortune. A **wish** can undo a single recent event. The **wish** forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a **wish** could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li></ul>You may try to use a **wish** to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a **wish** gives the DM the opportunity to fulfil your request without fulfilling it completely. (The **wish** may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment). For example, wishing for a **staff of the** magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff's current owner. Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisoned in a hidden extradimensional space (as by an imprisonment spell), where you could &quot;live&quot; indefinitely.
Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells)}}
