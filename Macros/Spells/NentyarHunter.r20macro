**1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras.
**2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
**3rd Round:** The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in  line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope.
When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Search DC 23 for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate).
One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
(The head of a worm or a snake could be thus ensnared, for example).
If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it.
The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs.
If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
The snare is magical.
To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action.
The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points.
A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell}}

The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration&#8212;the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.
This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the caster's option.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.

You call a swordlike beam of moonlight into your hand. Anyone who can cast moon blade can wield the beam with proficiency. However, if you are proficient with any type of sword, you can wield the beam as if it were any type of sword and thus gain the benefits of any special sword skill you might have, such as Weapon Focus.
Attacks with a moon blade are melee touch attacks. Its strike saps vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds but dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (to a maximum of +10) to any type of creature except undead. Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade. Their substance boils away from its touch, and they take 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +20) per blow. The blade is immaterial, and your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage.
A successful moon blade strike temporarily scrambles magic. On the target's next turn after a hit from a moon blade, the creature must make a Concentration check to use any spell or spell-like ability. The DC is equal to 10 + damage dealt + spell level. (An opponent hit by a moon blade while casting a spell must make the usual Concentration check to avoid losing the spell in addition to the check on its next turn.)

Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone.

Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.

You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength.
The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration.
You may create an &quot;eye&quot; of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit (for example, a 20-foot-diameter tornado centered 100 feet away).
Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area.<ul><li>A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.</li><li>An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center.</li><li>A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion.</li><li>A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.</li></ul>
Wind Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level.
(The categories of wind strength are briefly described below, with more detail to be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area.
Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.
A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.
A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.
Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.
A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees}}

The first tree you enter and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours.
By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into.
You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.
You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree).
The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree.
This means that in a thick oak forest, a 10th-level druid
could make ten transports over the course of 10 rounds, traveling as far as 30,000 feet (about 6 miles) in doing so.
Each transport is a full-round action.
You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends.
If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete}}

Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC.
Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation.
(Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall).
You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level.
This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action.
For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed).
For example, a creature that rolled 25 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round.
Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above.
A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside.
In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends.
Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.
A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons.
Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work.
Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.
Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants}}

The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a maze spell.
Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale.
Thus, the subject could not find the way to &quot;a forest where a green dragon lives&quot; or &quot;a hoard of platinum pieces&quot;, but it could find the exit to a labyrinth.
The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take.
For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph of warding.
The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.
Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round.
This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians)}}

The spell has five charges when cast.
Once per round as a standard action, a single allied creature within 30 feet can drain one charge from the healing circle.
The first charge so drained functions as a cure critical wounds spell, the second as a cure serious wounds spell, the third as a cure moderate wounds spell, and the fourth as a cure light wounds spell, and the final charge heals only 5 points of damage.
A creature must be conscious to draw a charge from the healing circle.

Moon path allows you to create a stair or bridge from one spot to another. The effect is a railless ribbon of glowing white translucent force like a glass strip. The strip can be from 3 to 20 feet wide as you decide. (You can vary the width over the ribbon's length if you want.) It sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are in midair.
At the time of casting, you designate up to one creature per caster level to receive extra protection while standing on or moving along the moon path. Protected creatures gain the benefit of a sanctuary effect. This functions like the 1st-level spell **sanctuary** except that the save DC is 15 + your Wis modifier, and any subject of the spell who attacks breaks the sanctuary effect for all subjects. Protected creatures also stick to the top of the moon path as though they have received spider climb spells. A creature loses both benefits immediately when it leaves the path.
Unlike a **wall of force**, a moon path can be dispelled. It is otherwise similar to a wall of force in that it needs no supports and it is immune to damage of all kinds. A disintegrate spell blasts a hole in the path 10 feet square, leaving the rest of the path intact. (If the moon path is 10 feet wide or less, this merely creates a 10-foot gap.) A hit from a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction destroys a moon path. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a moon path, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures. Gaze attacks cannot operate through a moon path. 
A moon path must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed. If its surface would be interrupted by any object or creature, the spell fails. The bridge version of the spell must be created flat. The stair version cannot rise or descend any more sharply than 45 degrees}}

All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage (see Table 2-2 in the Dungeon Master's Guide). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). 
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase your size while you are still under the effect of the first casting}}
