In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing.
The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning.
The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.
Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute.
Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical, but comprehend languages is often useful when deciphering treasure maps.
This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the secret page and illusory script spells).
It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.
Comprehend languages can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
**1st Round:** Presence or absence of evil.
**2nd Round:** Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.
**3rd Round:** The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. 
**Aura Power:** An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. 
For example, as indicated on the table, an evil outsider with 12 HD has an overwhelming aura of evil. A good cleric who casts this spell and directs it at the location of such a creature for longer than 1  round loses the spell and is stunned for 1 round if his character level is 6th or lower.

If **detect evil** is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them.

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as illusory script.
Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw.
A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation.
Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast.
The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.
Typical suggestions include &quot;Close the book and leave&quot;, &quot;Forget the existence of the book&quot;, and so forth.
If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear.
The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.
The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell}}

It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests.
It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut).
If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes.
In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.
Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.
The effect is limited by the area.
A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot
door).
Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.
Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two knock spells}}

The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight.
An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (page 219).
If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each.
(Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect).
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save.
For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth.
This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like)}}

Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject.

A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much it enjoyed drinking poison, is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine.
More useful applications of modify memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you (inclining the subject to act favorably toward you), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that it ever saw you or your party.
