(The hit points can be healed as normal).
For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand.
The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack.
The hand always strikes from your direction.
The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can.
After it delivers a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers.
The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons.
It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of at least 22.

The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place.  They remain animated until they are destroyed.
(A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).
Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of **animate dead**.  (The <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/desecrate--2604/">deserate</a> spell doubles this limit; see page 218).
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled.  (You choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
**Skeletons:** A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons.
**Zombies:** A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie. The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies}}

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

You must make a ranged touch attack to hit.

If the subject has at least as many negative levels as HD, it dies.
Each negative level gives a creature a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).
Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest available level.
Negative levels stack.
Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours).
Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the victim's levels, but the negative levels from enervation don't last long enough to do so.
An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4&#215;5 temporary hit points for 1 hour}}

These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot&#8212;including water.
They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.
Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles.
Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19.
Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8.
The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.
Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage.
The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.
Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles.
Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.

Once the spell is cast, your blood takes on a mystical potency that makes it more corrosive than the strongest acid to anyone who draws it from you.
From then on, until the spell's duration has elapsed, anyone who deals slashing or piercing melee damage on you is sprayed with your blood in retribution.
The blood deals a cumulative 1d6 points of damage per attack upon your attacker, with no save or spell resistance applicable, up to a maximum of 5d6.
Thus, the first time a foe hits you with a slashing or piercing weapon, he instantly takes 1d6 points of damage from the sanguinary backlash.
The second time that same foe strikes you, he takes 2d6 points of damage.
As soon as any single foe has taken 5d6 points of damage in a single spray from your corrosive blood, the spell ends.
Opponents striking you with magical attacks that do not manifest in a slashing or piercing manner, or those striking you with only bludgeoning weapons, do not trigger the retributive blood spray.
The arc and direction of the blood spray is magical in nature, and the spray does not splatter adjacent squares or parties, no matter how close together they might be.
Each spray strikes only the one responsible for the wound.

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar.
You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body.
The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.
To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it.
When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.
While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence).
You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures.
You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures.
In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.
(Undead creatures are powered by negative energy.
Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls).
For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within the range, all powered by positive energy.
You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.
Attempting to possess a body is a fullround action.
It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward.
You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save.
Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.
If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar.
You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.
The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities.
For example, a fish's body breathes water and a troll's body regenerates.
A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities.
The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.
As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body.
The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.
If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead).
If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die.
Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.
If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed).
If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range).
Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or at the host's location}}

The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage.
The nightmare leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.
The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.
Dispel evil cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the nightmare and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the dispel evil.
If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting.
If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell (see page 69) or the spell ends.
If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.
You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance.
(You always fail any saving throw, for example).
Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or dream are immune to this spell}}

The nature of the undead creature is determined by the caster level of this spell, as per create undead (see page 215 of the Player's Handbook).
Once the task is complete or the original geas (or similar spell) expires, the magic animating the subject ends and he returns to death.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward.
The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated.
If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.
The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw.
If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell.
If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).
The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier).
It can try each method once per day.
If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.
A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel.
You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil, page 246) to make the trap more secure.
If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare.
You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward.
You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check.
The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward.
If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service.
New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours.
This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell.
Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.
If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.
Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.
The creature might later seek revenge.
If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as &quot;Wait here&quot; or &quot;Defend this area against attack&quot;), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.
Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
For example, lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental}}

The type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.
<table><tr><th>Caster Level </th><th>Undead Created </th></tr><tr><td> 11th or lower </td><td> Ghoul </td></tr><tr><td> 12th-14th </td><td> Ghast </td></tr><tr><td> 15th-17th </td><td> Mummy </td></tr><tr><td> 18th or higher </td><td> Mohrg</td></tr></table>You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. For example, at 16th level you could decide to create a ghoul or a ghast instead of a mummy. Doing this may be a good idea, because created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159).
This spell must be cast at night.
Material Component: A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The spell must be cast on a dead body. You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless shells}}

**Sickened:** Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject's body. A sickened creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a remove disease or heal spell, but a remove curse is effective.
**Panicked:** The subject becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.
**Comatose:** The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a sleep effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level.

When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150.
The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.
Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first.
Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.
A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.
Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).
To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.
Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.
As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.
Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).
Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.
In this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.
Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.
You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.
Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.
These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.
Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.
For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.
Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.
If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.
Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.
Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.
Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.
Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.
You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.
Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.
An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.
Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.
Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death}}

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons (MM 225) or zombies (MM 265) with maximum hit points for their Hit Dice. If you can control them, these undead follow your spoken commands. The undead remain animated until destroyed (a destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).
Regardless of the specific numbers or kinds of undead created with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead with this spell than four times your caster level with a single casting of plague of undead.
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell or animate dead (PH 198), however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. The limit imposed by this spell and the animate dead spell are the same, meaning that creatures you animate with either spell count against this limit. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings of this spell or animate dead become uncontrolled. Any time you must release part of the undead that you control because of this spell or animate dead, you choose which undead are released until the total HD of undead you control is equal to four times your caster level.
The bones and bodies required for this spell follow the same restrictions as animate dead.
