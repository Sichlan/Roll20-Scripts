The effect is similar to a detect evil spell, but does not require concentration and discerns aura location and strength more quickly.
You know the location and strength of all evil auras within your sight.
An aura's strength depends on the type and Hit Dice of any evil creature, as noted in the description of the detect evil spell in the Player's Handbook}}

You must transfer at least 20 points.
Transferred hit points are damage to you.
The creature takes your transferred hit points as if receiving a cure wounds spell and cannot gain more hit points than its maximum allows; any excess points are lost.
This spell transfers only actual hit points, not temporary hit points.
An unconscious target is considered a &quot;willing creature&quot; for purposes of this spell}}

Each subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
In addition, each subject takes only one-half the normal hit point damage from any attack, and you take the remainder.
Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, ability damage, level draining, and disintegration, are not affected.
If a subject's hit points are reduced because of a lowered Constitution score, that reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage.
When the spell ends, any subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subjects, but the damage you took for the subjects is not reassigned to them.
If you die while glory of the martyr is in effect, the spell ends in a burst of positive energy that restores 1d8 hit points to each subject.
If a subject dies or moves out of range of the spell, that subject's connection to you is severed, but the spell remains in force with respect to other subjects.
If your connection with all subjects is severed, the spell ends}}
