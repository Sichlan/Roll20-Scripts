However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall.
Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.
You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn.
This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance.
If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.
(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on falling objects).
Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects.

It attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + the modifier for your spell save DCs.
Each hit deals 1 point of Strength damage to the target.
The first time a target is hit, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect; this negates the damage and renders it immune to further attacks by the shadow double.
The shadow double occupies a space identical to yours.
It is not incorporeal, and thus can't share a space with another creature or object.
It can provide a flanking bonus against any creature that hasn't yet saved successfully against it.
The shadow double can strike incorporeal creatures, but not ethereal creatures.
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to direct the shadow double to attack any other target.
To attack this new target, the shadow double can move to any new legal space within 30 feet (it moves by instantaneous teleportation).
If it is not commanded to switch targets, it continues to attack the same target.
A shadow double can be attacked.
It has an Armor Class equal to 10 + your size modifier + a deflection bonus equal to the modifier for your spell save DCs, and has one-fifth of your full normal hit points.

The new form must be within one size category of your normal size.  The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level.  You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.  You retain your own ability scores.  Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same.
You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.  Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.  You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind.  The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.  Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form}}

A weapon affected by this spell gains the ability to move and attack on its own and functions in most ways like an animated object of its size (MM 13).
Treat a light weapon as an object two size categories smaller than its wielder, a one-handed weapon as one size category smaller than its wielder, and a two-handed weapon as an object of the same size as its wielder.
However, the weapon deals its normal damage, not the damage noted for an animated object of its size, and it gains a bonus on attack rolls equal to the ability modifier used to set your spell save DCs.
Diminutive or smaller objects are unaffected by the spell.
An animated weapon attacks the nearest enemy to the best of its ability.
You can use a move action to direct it to a different target, but if at the end of your turn you are more than 30 feet from the weapon, the spell ends.
A weapon held or carried by another creature can't be affected by this spell.
The weapon doesn't gain the benefit of any of your class features, feats, or other special abilities that would improve its combat ability.
If the weapon has an enhancement bonus or other special properties, these apply as normal.
For example, an animated +1 flaming longsword gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit}}

Only creatures and objects in the sphere can be seen, and only creatures in the sphere can see within the sphere, unless other observers can naturally see in the dark.

If the target creature fails its saving throw, this spell creates in the subject's mind an illusory double of whichever creature currently threatens it that it deems most dangerous. The form of this phantom foe changes as appropriate whenever the target perceives a different threatening creature more dangerous than the last. This illusory double provides two effects.
First, the subject believes it is being flanked by the phantom foe and the real creature the foe duplicates. Thus, the duplicated creature is always considered to be flanking the subject in melee. A creature that can't be flanked is immune to this aspect of the spell.
Second, the subject of the spell is unable to determine that the phantom foe is not a real threat, and whenever the subject attempts to attack the creature duplicated by the phantom foe, that creature benefits from a 50% miss chance against attacks from the subject of the spell. Because this miss chance comes from the subject's inability to tell the phantom foe from the original, it is rolled separately from any miss chance that applies due to displacement or concealment.
Creatures other than the subject cannot see the phantom foe, although they can attempt to guess its location by how the target acts. If the subject is not threatened by any creature at the start of its turn, the spell ends}}

You gain the ability to run up columns of smoke as if they were normal stairs.
Casting this spell successfully requires smoke from a natural fire large enough to fill a 5-foot square, such as a normal campfire, bonfire, or any significant amount of burning debris (torch f lames or creatures made of fire or smoke do not suffice).
After casting this spell, you can move into the column of smoke produced by such fires and can ascend vertically into a square filled with smoke.
To your eyes the smoke coalesces into ghostly steps, though other observers see nothing different.
When stepping into the column you are considered to be in the smoke above the flame and take no damage from the fire.
Every 5 feet of upward movement costs 2 squares of movement.
For example, an assassin with a speed of 30 feet casts smoke stairs on himself, then moves 10 feet across the ground to a smoking fire and ascends 10 feet vertically in a single move action.
If anything dissipates the column of smoke while you are moving though it using this spell, you lose your footing and fall.
Examples include a gust of wind spell and an air elemental's whirlwind form.
If the fire creating the smoke is extinguished, the smoke stairs effect lingers for 1 round before dispersing.

A double of you appears nearby.
You create a fetch, a perfect replica of your form at the time you cast this spell.
Little more than an animated reproduction, a fetch is mindless but capable of performing simple tasks or imitating you.
The creation is the same size as you and occupies space just as a living creature does.
You have a mental connection with your fetch and can give it new orders as a standard action.
The fetch duplicates your form in every way but texture.
You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is; this result is opposed by observers' Spot checks as normal.
Anyone touching the fetch finds it rubbery and soft, and in so doing immediately realizes its magical nature.
The fetch's body includes useless versions of all the equipment you possess: A weapon wielded by the fetch is too flimsy to deal damage, and tools it carries are fragile and imprecise.
Items created with a fetch are part of its form and dissipate if separated from it.
At your order, the fetch can retrieve things for you, open unstuck doors, hold chairs, and the like, as well as perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending.
The fetch can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a skill that can't be used untrained.
It can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity tirelessly if ordered to do so as long as you remain within the spell's range.
You can have the fetch imitate you, such as by sitting at a desk and pretending to write, lying in bed and breathing deeply, or skulking with a weapon drawn.
It can even imitate tasks it can't actually perform, though it automatically fails any attempt at such performance&#8212;for instance, even though a fetch can pretend to decipher an ancient text, it can't actually do it.
The fetch weighs roughly the same as you do, so it can trigger any traps you would if you were to pass through the same space, setting off tripwires, pressure plates, some magical forms of detection, and similar devices.
Its land speed is normal for a creature of your kind (for example, 30 feet for a human or 20 feet for a halfling).
Even if you normally have other modes of movement available (such as a fly or swim speed), the fetch can't use those.
The fetch automatically fails any saving throw required of it.
If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.
The fetch has an effective Strength score of 6, so it can lift 60 pounds or drag 300 pounds.
Its Dexterity is 10, so it has an AC of 10 (plus size modifier).
It gains no AC benefit from any equipment or effect on you when the spell is cast (such as armor you wear, since the armor created for it is part of its form), though it can then wear real armor or other items to increase its Armor Class.
It has no Constitution score and 10 hit points; if reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
It can't be healed, nor can it benefit from temporary hit points.
The fetch has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score.
You can command it to make noise, but it can't communicate in any way, nor can it understand instructions other than the simple orders you give it telepathically.
The fetch cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll.
Even if armed, it doesn't threaten an area around it and thus can't flank an enemy, nor can it use the aid another action to improve your Armor Class or attack rolls.
The fetch has the same alignment aura as you do.
Detect thoughts does not register its existence (since it has no Intelligence), but detect magic reveals it as a magical effect}}

This has no impact on your ability to cast spells or perform other actions.
Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a true strike effect (as the spell) on yourself as a standard action.
This effect lasts for the normal duration of the true strike spell (a single attack), after which the entire spell's duration ends.

Once you successfully target a creature with implacable pursuer, you know its location as long as the subject is moving, no matter where it goes on the same plane.

The shadows easily move with you, guiding your steps and how to hold your body.**
While this spell is in effect, you gain a number of benefits. The shadows wrapping your form grant you a +4 competence bonus on Escape Artist, Hide, and Move Silently checks. Your shadowy form also  provides you with concealment. This shadowy concealment is not negated by a see invisibility spell, but a true seeing spell counteracts the effect. Standing within the radius of a daylight spell or in bright  natural sunlight temporarily suppresses the concealment effect.
In addition, if you have 5 ranks in Escape Artist, you can attempt to slip through a solid object or barrier up to 5 feet thick with a DC 20 Escape Artist check, though doing this ends the spell as soon as the attempt is completed (regardless of success). If you have 10 ranks in Escape Artist, you can attempt to pass through an object or barrier up to 10 feet thick. If you have 15 ranks in Escape Artist, you can attempt to pass through a barrier composed of magical force (or similar magical obstacles).

The spell temporarily transposes some of the subject's tissue with shadow-stuff, making the subject partially incorporeal. This partially incorporeal state does not allow the subject to pass through walls or other solid objects.

When you cast sniper's eye, you gain the following benefits:
- +10 competence bonus on Spot checks.
- Darkvision out to 60 feet.
- The ability to make a ranged sneak attack at a range of up to 60 feet, rather than 30 feet.
- The ability to make a death attack with a ranged weapon rather than just with a melee weapon. The target must be within 60 feet.
- This spell doesn't grant you the ability to make a sneak attack or death attack if you don't already have that ability.
Sniper's eye attunes you completely to the vantage point you had when you cast the spell. You understand the nuances of the breeze and every angle and shadow - from that spot.

Spell resistance applies against this effect.
If any round of the spell's duration goes by in which no living creature is affected by the spell (either because you didn't hit a living creature or because no saving throw was failed), you take 1d6 points of damage from the spell.
