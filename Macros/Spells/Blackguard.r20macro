For instance, if you cast turn anathema as a good spell, you could attempt to turn creatures of the evil subtype, such as demons.

You bind the dread essence of a narzugon to a target creature, filling it with the misery and horror that defines the devil's existence.
The subject of this spell can use a baleful gaze as a standard action.
The gaze affects a single creature within 20 feet.
That creature must succeed on a Will save against the spell's save DC or be immobilized for 1 round as if affected by a hold monster spell.
Baatezu are immune to this gaze attack.
Once a creature has successfully resisted this effect, it cannot be affected by this gaze from the same creature for 24 hours.
The subject also gains resistance to fire 10.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the narzugon).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.

While under the effect of this spell, a creature is infused with the disruptive power of an orthon.
As an immediate action, the subject of this spell can erect a 20-foot-radius field that disrupts teleportation spells or effects.
All creatures in the area are prevented from using any spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that provides such movement, as if they were in the area of a dimensional lock spell.
Each use of this field lasts 1 round.
In addition, the subject of the spell gains the benefit of a sonic shield for as long as the spell remains in effect.
This shield functions like the fire shield spell, except that it deals sonic damage instead of cold or fire, and the subject takes half damage from acid-based attacks.
If exposed to an acid attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, the subject takes no damage on a successful save.
The subject gains resistance to fire 10.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the orthon).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.

The beating of its hooves grows almost deafening, and the world around you begins to shimmer.
If you cast this spell while mounted on your special mount or mount-sized fiendish companion, you tap into the energies normally released only when you summon or dismiss that creature, creating a short-range teleportation effect.
Between a single pair of steps, you and your mount can teleport directly forward once, moving up to 5 feet per two caster levels.
Many paladins use this spell to attack over rough terrain that would normally prevent a charge.
Because this spell can be cast while your mount is moving, the creature can move part of its speed both before and after the spell takes effect.
If you cast this spell in conjunction with master cavalier (page 124) and war-mount (page 129), the three spells have a synergistic effect.

If the creature discharging the item is an animal or plant, it must save against fear or flee in terror (or cower, if it cannot move) for 1d4 minutes.
On a successful save, the creature is merely shaken for the same length of time.
If the creature discharging the item is a shapechanger, an image of its natural form or most common alternate form appears for 1d4 rounds, superimposed over its body, revealing its true nature to all witnesses.

The darkness from this spell also has a number of additional qualities:
First, the darkened area acts as a desecrate spell.
Second, a good dragon or dragonblood creature cannot enter the area of darkness unless it makes a Will save.
If it makes the saving throw, it can enter the area, but each round that it remains in the area of darkness, it takes 2d6 points of damage and is dazed.
A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the daze effect.
Third, shadow of the Dark Queen counters and dispels light of Xymor, and it also counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, including daylight and light.
