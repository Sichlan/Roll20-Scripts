**1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras.
**2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
**3rd Round:** The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in  line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. 
<table><tr><th colspan="1"></th><th style="text-align:center;" colspan="4">Aura Power </th></tr><tr><th>Spell or Object </th><th>Faint </th><th>Moderate </th><th>Strong </th><th>Overwhelming </th></tr><tr><td> Functioning spell (spell level) </td><td> 3rd or lower </td><td> 4th-6th </td><td> 7th-9th </td><td> 10th+ (deity level) </td></tr><tr><td> Magic Item (caster level) </td><td> 5th or lower </td><td> 6th-11th </td><td> 12th-20th </td><td> 21st+ (artifact) </td></tr></table>Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:
<table><tr><th>Original Strength </th><th>Duration of Lingering Aura </th></tr><tr><td> Faint</td><td> 1d6 rounds </td></tr><tr><td> Moderate</td><td> 1d6 minutes </td></tr><tr><td> Strong</td><td> 1d6×10 minutes </td></tr><tr><td> Overwhelming</td><td> 1d6 days </td></tr></table>Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.
Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

You create an aura of blue mist that protects you against fire, absorbing the first 10 points of fire damage as a resist energy (fire) spell (PH 272). In addition to the resist energy (fire) effect, the spell can be used to snuff out fires.
Any nonmagical flame that the aura contacts is immediately extinguished if the flame's maximum damage is 10 or fewer points per round. This means that torches, small fires, and hurled alchemist's fire are snuffed out and cause no damage if used against you or if you touch them.
You can use a standard action to touch an existing magical fire (such as a flaming sphere or a wall of fire) and attempt to dispel it as if using a dispel magic spell against it (use the caster level of aura against flame for the caster level check). If you succeed, you take no damage from the touch and the magical fire and aura both vanish. If you fail, you take damage from the magical fire source normally (reduced by your aura against flame), and both spells remain.
With a readied action, you can use the aura as a dispel magic effect to counterspell a magical fire attack against you. If successful, the spell is counterspelled and the aura disappears. If you fail the dispel check, or if the attack is not a fire attack, the aura remains}}

Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine.

Based on an assessment of your immediate surroundings and chosen path of travel, you receive one of three visions that reflect the next hour's journey: safety, peril, or great danger.
The base chance for receiving an accurate reply is 70% +1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly.
If the omen of peril is successful, you get one of three visions, which lasts just a second or two.
<ul><li>Safety: You aren't in any immediate danger. If you continue on your present course (or remain where you are if you have been stationary for some time before casting the spell), you will face no significant monsters, traps, or other challenges for the next hour or so.</li></ul><ul><li>Peril: You will face challenges typical of an adventure: challenging but not overwhelming monsters, dangerous traps, and other hazards for the next hour or so.</li></ul><ul><li>Great Danger: Your very life is at grave risk. You will likely face powerful NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour.</li></ul>If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don't necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly.
Choosing which vision is &quot;correct&quot; takes some educated guesswork on the part of the DM, who should assess the characters' likely courses of action and what dangers they're likely to face.
The exact form that an omen of peril takes depends on whether you worship a specific deity, venerate nature as a druid, or simply uphold abstract principles. A druid might see a white dove for safety, a dark cloud obscuring the sun for peril, and a forest fire for great danger. A cleric of Fharlanghn might get a vision of a straight road for safety, a crossroads for peril, and a washed-out bridge for great danger.
Unlike the more powerful <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/augury--2478/">**augury**</a> spell (PH 202), an omen of peril doesn't respond to a specific question. It indicates only the level of danger likely for the next hour, not what form the danger will take.

The feeling passes as you designate the area of the spell, where the flames there flicker for a moment as if a gust of wind had hit them.**
This spell lends fuel to existing fires within the spell's area, allowing them to burn off the intangible power of passion as much as from physical substance. Because these fires consume less of the physical fuel that sustain them, they burn for twice as long without losing any of their intensity, but their illumination radius is halved.
In addition, an affected fire is much harder to extinguish. It takes twice as long to put out a fire that is under the effect of this spell, and if a roll is required (such as the Reflex save required to extinguish flames if a creature is on fire), two successful rolls over 2 rounds are required to successfully put out the fire. If one such roll fails, the creature must begin trying to extinguish the flames again as if it had never succeeded on the first roll.
Magical fire used against a target in this spell's area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, does not burn as effectively, and fire damage from such sources is reduced by 1 point per die.
Slow burn counters or dispels the effect of <a href="/spells/spell-compendium--86/raging-flame--4055/">**raging flame**</a> (page 164).

A wood wose is a translucent green nature spirit that you can command to perform simple natural tasks. It can build a campfire, gather herbs, feed an animal companion, catch a fish, or perform any other simple task that doesn't involve knowledge of technology. It cannot, for example, open a latched chest, since it doesn't know how a latch works.
A wood wose can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity if told to do so. Thus, if you commanded it to gather leaves, it would continue to do so while you turned your attention elsewhere, as long as you remained within range.
A wood wose has an effective Strength of 2, so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds. It can trigger traps, but the 20 pounds of force it can exert is not enough to activate most pressure plates. It has a land speed of 15 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet (perfect).
A wood wose cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll or a saving throw. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. If you attempt to send the wose beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist}}

The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies.  The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.
Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you.  It advances and awaits your bidding.  You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain).  The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own.  You can attach some small item or note to the messenger.  The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.  Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored.  The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example)}}

In a moment you're safe, and you gain a brief respite&#8212;time enough to cast more permanent protective spells.**
You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 150).
Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows a character to breathe water on a water-dominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by avoid planar effects can't be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character's full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don't deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects.
In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects. In the D&amp;D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane.
The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades).
The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won't protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane}}

You gain a +4 insight bonus on Balance checks. If you have sufficient ranks in the Balance skill, you can even balance on an otherwise-impossible surface with a DC 20 Balance check.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you can balance on vertical surfaces; the normal modifier for a sloped or angled surface no longer applies to you, though other DC modifiers (such as for a slippery surface) do apply. If you balance on a vertical surface, you can move up or down as if you were climbing. However, you are not actually climbing, so you can make attacks normally, retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and generally follow the rules of the Balance skill rather than the Climb skill.
If you have 10 or more ranks in Balance, you can balance on liquids, semisolid surfaces such as mud or snow, or similar surfaces that normally couldn't support your weight. For each consecutive round that you begin balanced on a particular surface of this sort, the DC of your Balance check increases by 5.

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.
Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell (Magic item's saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled.
It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.
The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration.
During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage.
In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.
Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage.
Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.
Chill metal counters and dispels heat metal}}

A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture and low walls.
It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.
The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns.
It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size.
The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame.
It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles.
A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.
Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell.
(Magic item's saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated.
It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.
The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration.
During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage.
In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.
Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage roll from a heat metal spell indicates 2 points of fire damage and the subject is hit by a ray of frost in the same round and takes 3 points of cold damage, it winds up taking no fire damage and only 1 point of cold damage.
If cast underwater, heat metal deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.

When you cast this spell, you trace the cerulean sign in the air with a hand, leaving a glowing blue rune in the air for a
brief moment before it flashes and fills the area of effect with a pulse of cerulean light.
Any aberration within the area must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the following ill effects.
Closer aberrations are affected first.
Each effect lasts for 1 round.
None: The aberration suffers no ill effect, even if it fails the
saving throw.
Sickened: The aberration takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round.
Nauseated: The aberration cannot attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything but take a single move action for 1 round.
Dazed: The aberration can take no actions, but has no penalty to its Armor Class, for 1 round.
Stunned: The aberration drops everything held, can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round.
Once a creature recovers from an effect, it moves up one level on the table.
Thus, a creature that is stunned by this spell is dazed the round after that, nauseated the round after that, sickened the round after that, and then recovers fully the next round}}

If the subject hits with its bite attack, it attaches itself to the foe and deals automatic bite damage each round it remains attached. It does not need to make a grapple check, and it does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An attached attacker loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. It cannot use other weapons while attached, but each attack upon from the grappled foe requires a successful grapple check. Others can attack an attached creature with a weapon or grapple.

If you succeed, the target becomes entangled in the thick strands of kelp and is grappled. Each round, the target can attempt to escape the kelpstrand by making a successful grapple or Escape Artist check against the kelpstrand's grapple check. You are not considered grappling yourself while using this spell. Once you shoot your strands of kelp, you need not take any action to maintain the effect.
A creature targeted with multiple kelpstrands has to make separate grapple or Escape Artist checks against each kelpstrand currently grappling it to escape. If you cast this spell while you are within 300 feet of the ocean shore, you gain a +4 bonus on any grapple checks made to determine the outcome of a kelpstrand grapple.

For all intents and purposes, you no longer exist while merged with the animal, and you cannot be detected or affected by anything as long as you remain within it.
While melded with the animal, you mentally direct its actions. You can make it attack, run, or take any other action it could normally physically accomplish. However, because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it can undertake actions normally beyond its own instincts (such as manipulating objects with its claws or mouth). Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger) are ignored. You receive direct sensory input from the creature using its normal senses and skill modifiers.
You cannot take any mental actions while within the animal other than directing it or dismissing the effect (such that you cannot manifest a psionic power or cast a spell, even if it has no components).
Injury to the animal has no effect on you. If the animal is killed, if the spell is dispelled or dismissed, or if the spell's duration expires, you appear (as if leaping forth from the animal) in an open space of your choice within 10 feet of the animal's position. If no open space exists, you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet so moved.

This spell only works on a portal you are able to activate; for example, if you are an elf and the target portal doesn't work for elves, you can't use this spell on the portal.
The extradimensional space created by this spell is similar to that created by a rope trick spell but can only hold you and your gear (up to your maximum heavy load).
When the spell ends, you exit the portal at either your point of entry or the portal's destination.
While within this extradimensional space, you can see the origin and destination locations, though the images are blurry (much like viewing the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane).
Dispel magic or gate seal traps you within the extradimensional space for as long as the portal is negated or sealed (as would surrounding both ends with a dead magic area).
Mordenkainen's disjunction or some other effect that destroys a portal outright forcibly ejects you from one random end of the portal and deals 5d6 points of damage to you.

You gain the ability to run up columns of smoke as if they were normal stairs.
Casting this spell successfully requires smoke from a natural fire large enough to fill a 5-foot square, such as a normal campfire, bonfire, or any significant amount of burning debris (torch f lames or creatures made of fire or smoke do not suffice).
After casting this spell, you can move into the column of smoke produced by such fires and can ascend vertically into a square filled with smoke.
To your eyes the smoke coalesces into ghostly steps, though other observers see nothing different.
When stepping into the column you are considered to be in the smoke above the flame and take no damage from the fire.
Every 5 feet of upward movement costs 2 squares of movement.
For example, an assassin with a speed of 30 feet casts smoke stairs on himself, then moves 10 feet across the ground to a smoking fire and ascends 10 feet vertically in a single move action.
If anything dissipates the column of smoke while you are moving though it using this spell, you lose your footing and fall.
Examples include a gust of wind spell and an air elemental's whirlwind form.
If the fire creating the smoke is extinguished, the smoke stairs effect lingers for 1 round before dispersing.
Material Component: A handful of dried leaves}}

Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped.
You affect a 10-footsquare area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM's option).
Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected.
Earth or stone creatures are not affected.
A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells.
A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge.
Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface.
Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.
For example, a party of adventurers trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall.
While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected.
Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.
A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure (such as a wall or a tower) by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle.
However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed}}

You create a plume of smoke that you capture in a special bottle you're holding. If the bottle is thereafter opened before the spell duration expires, the smoke emerges to form a vaguely horselike creature made of wisps of smoke. It makes no sound, and anything that touches it simply passes through it.
To mount this smoke horse, the would-be rider must make a DC 10 Ride check while holding the bottle in one hand. Anyone attempting to mount without the bottle simply passes through the horse's form. Letting go of the bottle after mounting causes the rider to fall through the horse's smoky form; he or she cannot thereafter remount without the intact bottle in hand. If the bottle is broken, the spell ends immediately and the rider (if mounted) falls to the ground.
The smoke horse has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can send smoke billowing out behind it at the rider's behest, leaving behind a bank of smoke 5 feet wide and 20 feet high as it moves. A severe wind, or magical wind of any kind, disperses the horse (and any smoke it has produced) instantly. Otherwise, the bank of smoke lasts 10 minutes, starting on the turn it was laid down. Starting or stopping the smoke trail is a free action. The mount and the smoke trail it produces give concealment to anyone behind them.
The mount is immune to all damage and other attacks because material objects and spells simply pass through it. It cannot attack.
The rider can return the smoke horse to the bottle, and thus pause the spell, at any time by simply uncorking it (a move action) and stoppering it again (another move action) in the next round after the horse is inside. If the bottle is reopened later, the spell reactivates with its remaining duration intact. Regardless of how much duration remains unused, the spell ceases functioning 24 hours after it is cast. If dispelled at any time while the bottle is corked, the spell ends}}

This spell transforms your arms into wings of brilliant fire. The flame does not damage you or any items you carry.

You can charge but not run while flying, and you cannot carry more than a light load aloft. Using a **fire wings** spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so you can take other actions normally.
If the spell duration expires while you are aloft, you descend at a rate of 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds, then fall the rest of the distance if you haven't already landed. Because dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subjects also descends in this way if the **fire wings** spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by and **antimagic field**. If you are not flying, you can make up to two attacks each round with the fire wings as if they were natural weapons, a successful attack deals 2d6 points of fire damage. The wings can be extinguished (and the spell canceled) by a **quench** spell, immersion in water, or a wind of hurricane or greater force.
**Material Component:** The feather or a bird, which you must burn when you cast the spell.
**Focus:** A golden amulet shaped like a phoenix (worth 150 gp}}

Creatures behind the dike receive cover. Attackers approaching on foot must scramble down into the ditch and then climbing 10 feet to reach the top of the dike (Climb DC 10).
<strong>Rough Outdoor Site or Cavern:</strong> Loose stones and boulders, dead wood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall 5 feet high and 2 feet thick at the base around the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the wall receive cover.
<strong>Marshy or Low-Lying Site:</strong> In areas such as marsh, bog, swamp, or tundra, nature's rampart cannot raise a wall, but instead creates a water-filled ditch 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep. Creatures forced to wade the ditch are reduced to 1/4 their normal speed (minimum 5 feet) and cannot charge or run.

The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope.
When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Search DC 23 for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate).
One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
(The head of a worm or a snake could be thus ensnared, for example).
If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it.
The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs.
If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
The snare is magical.
To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action.
The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points.
A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell}}

Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by one-half.

A set of ghostly dinosaur jaws come into being and attack the creature you designate.**
This spell creates a set of powerful jaws of force. The jaws attempt to grapple the designated opponent, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. The **spiritjaws** use your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) + your Wis modifier as it's attack bonus. If an initial attack hits, the **spirtjaws** deal 2d6 points of damage and attempt to start a grapple as a free action.  The jaws' bonus on grapple checks is equal to their attack bonus + 4.
Once the opponent is grappled, the jaws deal 2d6 points of damage with each subsequent grapple check. The target is considered to be grappling and can not move. The target creature no longer threatens squares and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against opponents not grappling it.
The set of jaws always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. Your feats do not affect the jaws. If the jaws move beyond the range of the spell, they vanish. Attacking the set of jaws has no effect. As a magical force effect, the jaws cannot be damaged, but **disintegrate** or a **sphere of annihilation** destroys it's effect.
The grappled opponent can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in band, and a Concentration check (DC20 + spell level) is made. A creature grappled by the set of jaws can attempt to escape by succeeding on a grapple check against the jaws or by making a successful Escape Artist check as a standard action opposed by the set of jaws' grapple check.
As a free action, you can direct the jaws to pin a grappled opponent instead of dealing damage with a grapple check. If the jaws win the opposed grapple check, the opponent is pinned. A pinned opponent is held immobile and must break the pin before it can escape the grapple. Creatures other than those grappling the pinned target gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls to hit it. If the jaws have multiple attacks (granted by your attack bonus), you can use them to cause damage to a pinned target or to make more grapple attempts against that target.
Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the **spiritjaws** to a new target. If you do not, the **spiritjaws** continue to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the **spiritjaws** switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the **spiritjaws** to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to.
If you become unable to command the jaws, they vanish}}

Any effect that deals electricity damage (such as a lightning bolt or a blue dragon's breath weapon) that passes within 30 feet of the storm shield is attracted to it and strikes the shield instead of its intended target.
In the case of area spells such as lightning bolt, this redirection occurs if any portion of the spell's area is within 30 feet of the storm shield.
In such a case, the entire effect is drawn to the storm shield,
and all creatures or objects that otherwise would have been in the spell's area remain unharmed.
The storm shield takes full damage (no saving throw) from any effect drawn into it.
The shield can absorb up to 20 points of electricity damage per caster level before dissipating.
Any remaining damage is applied to all creatures within 10 feet of the storm shield's position (Reflex half; spell resistance applies).
For example, suppose a storm shield cast by a 5th-level cleric has already absorbed 78 points of electricity damage when it is struck by a lightning bolt that deals 45 points of damage.
The first 22 points of damage is enough to destroy the storm shield, so every creature within 10 feet of it takes 23 points of electricity damage (or 11 with a successful save).

Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker's normal speed.
A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.
Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly.  The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds.  If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely.  If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.
You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air.  You can train a mount to move with the aid of air walk (counts as a trick; see page 74) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check}}

You can change the direction of an existing current, boost its strength, or cause still water to flow at a desired rate.
The new current speed and direction persists until the spell ends or you decide to alter the effect, which requires concentration.
You can choose to create an area of calm water up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the affected area if you so desire, and you can create a limited effect in a smaller circular area within the spell's range.
Current Direction: You can choose one of two basic current patterns to function over the spell's area.<ul><li>You can direct the current to flow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.</li><li>You can create a rotation, causing the water to swirl around the center in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.</li></ul>
Current Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease the current's speed by 10 feet.
For example, a 9th level druid could increase the speed of a vigorous current (20 feet per round) to a dangerous current (50 feet per round) or reduce it to calm, placid water.

Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch).
The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long.
In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates).
The spell has no effect on other creatures.
Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower.
Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates.
If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.
With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

However, dispel water cannot counter an instantaneous spell or effect.
You choose to use dispel water in one of three ways: to dry up a body of water, to counter a water-based spell or effect, or to dismiss an extraplanar creature of the water subtype.
Dry Up Water: This effect instantly destroys 200 cubic feet of water per level.
Remaining water rushes in to fill the void.
Cast in a large body of water, such as an ocean, the destruction of 1,000 or more cubic feet of water produces a strong current that pulls boats and creatures down.
Creatures caught in the current must make a DC 20 Swim check to avoid going under.
A creature that fails the Swim check is pulled down to a depth of 10 feet per caster level and must hold its breath or begin to drown (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
The current might capsize vessels: The chance is 95% for a craft shorter than 20 feet long, 50% for one from 20 to 60 feet long, and 20% for one over 60 feet long.
Counterspell:Used in this way, dispel water targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (see page 170 of the Player's Handbook).
It only counters spells and spell-like abilities that have the water descriptor, or appear on the Water domain spell list, or clearly involve water (such as create food and water, sleet storm, and wall of ice).
To successfully counter the other spell, you must make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level.
Dismiss Water Creature: Cast in this way, dispel water targets a single extraplanar creature of the water subtype within range.
The creature can negate the effect with a successful Will save (and its spell resistance, if any, applies).
If it fails to save or resist the spell, the creature is forced back to its home plane}}

With this spell, you create a swirling miniature storm that provides a measure of protection, but leaves you and those near you unaffected.
The storm that surrounds you has hurricane-force winds spinning in a circle with you at the center. Normal ranged attacks through the hurricane's windy area are impossible, and even heavier projectiles such as siege weapons and giant boulders take a -8 penalty on the attack roll.
Creatures who move inside the spell's area suffer effects depending on their size and whether they¿re airborne. Each creature must make a saving throw at the beginning of its turn or when in enters the affected area.
Medium or smaller creatures mus succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked 1d4&#215;10 feet away from the eye of the hurricane's center and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per10 feet traveled in this manner. Creatures blown away are knocked prone as well. Flying creatures are blown back 2d6&#215;10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.
Large creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6&#215;10 feet.
Huge creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be checked. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6&#215;5 feet.
Gargantuan and Colossal creatures can move through the spell's area without adverse consequences.
Even creatures that succeed on their saving throws must attempt them again whenever they start a turn inside the spell's area or whenever they move back into it.
The spell's area is effectively a sphere. Although the area is centered on you, you're not within the wind. if you move, the eye of the hurricane moves as well to keep you in the center. If you cast **eye of the hurricane** so that creatures are inside the eye when the spell begins, they must make Fortitude saves when your movement brings the area of wind upon them. Thereafter, if you move the spell area into a square occupied by another creature, that creature makes a Fortitude save at the beginning of its next turn (assuming the windy area of the spell is still on it).</}}

A creature wearing metal armor that fails its save is frozen in place.

The frozen creature takes the damage listed below.
In addition, it suffers a -6 penalty on attack rolls, a -8 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can't move.
A frozen character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + level of spell being cast) or lose the spell.
A creature wearing metal armor that makes its save takes half the damage listed below.
A creature not wearing metal armor that fails its save takes the damage listed below if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1, 2, 3, or 4 points; see the table) each round if it is not wearing metal armor or the metal that it is carrying weighs less than one-fifth of the creature's weight.
A creature not wearing or carrying metal less than one-fifth of its weight that makes its save is entirely unaffected by freeze armor.
Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.

A healing spirit flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability.
In the round you cast the spell and at the start of your turn once per round thereafter, you can direct the healing spirit to move and touch a creature by entering its space.
The spirit's touch carries positive energy, healing a living creature of 1d8 points of damage.
Since undead are powered by negative energy, a healing spirit damages them instead of healing them.
The spirit can affect an unwilling target (such as an undead) by succeeding on an incorporeal touch attack, using your base attack bonus and a Strength bonus of +0.
An undead creature hit by such an attack can use spell resistance against the effect and is allowed a Will save for half damage.

Its energies flow into you even as the spirits of the beasts and the trees always have.
The descriptor of this spell matches the non-neutral component of your own alignment.
For instance, if you are lawful neutral, you cast iconic manifestation as a lawful spell.
If you are neutral, you cannot cast it at all.
Once you cast the spell, you have up to 10 minutes per caster level to invoke its power before it is spent.
At any point during this period, you can choose to spend one daily use of your wild shape ability to take on aspects of your non-neutral alignment.
You temporarily acquire the celestial template (MM 31) if you are good, the fiendish template (MM 107) if you are evil, the anarchic template (Manual of the Planes 198) if you are chaotic, or the axiomatic template (Manual of the Planes 197) if you are lawful.
(If your campaign does not use Manual of the Planes, you can approximate the axiomatic template by using the celestial template, and substituting lawful for good and chaotic for evil.
You can approximate the anarchic template by using the fiendish template and making the same substitution).
Once invoked, this transformation lasts 1 minute per caster level.
You can still use your wild shape ability to take on other forms without negating this spell.
Note: Adding a template &quot;on the fly&quot; can dramatically slow game-play.

You speak the words and feel the power of the plane buckle within your mind, then relax as you impress order upon the chaos.**
This spell grants temporary control over the terrain of Limbo. Normally, unless controlled, the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 158) is just what the plane's name implies: a roiling soup of energy and elements. Natives learn to control it or to inhabit areas that have enjoyed some measure of control for a long period, but visitors to areas of &quot;raw&quot; limbo must make a DC 16 Wisdom check to gain control over the dangerous roil.
The perinarch spell gives you automatic control of a radius of raw Limbo (an area not already stabilized or within some other creature's control) in close range. Control allows you to reshape the raw limbo as you desire, adding or subtracting one of the four basic elements once per round as a standard action. A favorite among travelers from the Material Plane is a chunk of earth surrounded by a small atmosphere of air.
The effect of this spell overlaps with the control already (potentially) established with a Wisdom check. Your allies can give their control over to you concurrently with the spell being cast, if they so choose. Control cannot be wrested away from you while the spell is in effect (which is one of the best reasons to cast this spell, even if you have a high Wisdom). If you move more than 100 feet away from the area that you controlled, the order you imposed fades away.
You are unable to achieve any works of complexity within an area you control, but you can mix two or three elements in a crude fashion; a few examples are provided below. You can attempt to seize control of a new area that already contains foes; however, foes can make a Reflex save to get out of the area.
<strong>Thick Barrier:</strong> You can &quot;thicken&quot; empty air with dust and rock, creating a zone around yourself and your allies that outside creatures must hack or force a way through. Their speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures.
<strong>Fiery Barrier:</strong> You can create a thick field of flame that deals 3d10 points of fire damage to any creature attempting to pass through it. The field also deals 3d10 points of fire damage for each round a creature lingers within it.
<strong>Complete Barrier:</strong> You can create a complete barrier of solid stone up to 1 foot thick encircling yourself and your allies, preventing access by any other than the most accomplished tunnelers. On the other hand, you can attempt to trap foes within their own bubble of solid stone}}

When you cast this spell, a mass of avian shadows sur­rounds you, protecting you from attacks even as it grants you buoyant dexterity. The swirling shadows grant you concealment and soft cover (+4 to AC, but you gain no bonus on Reflex saves and cannot use your cover to make Hide checks). Furthermore, any creatures attempting melee attacks against you take 1d8 points of slashing damage from the raptor cloud. Creatures get no save against this damage, but spell resistance (if any) applies.
Creatures wielding reach weapons can attack you without taking damage, but creatures that have natural reach take damage as above.
Though a raptor cloud moves with you, you cannot deal damage with it by pushing it against creatures or objects. Only creatures that make melee attacks against you are subject to the cloud's defensive damage. However, you can elect to expend the spell's energy at any point by tar­geting the raptor cloud against a single adjacent creature or object as a standard action.

A raptor cloud gives you a certain amount of lift as it swirls around you, granting you a +5 bonus on Jump and Tumble checks as you roll and weave through melee.

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired.
The condition of the remains is not a factor.
So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death.
The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand.
This process takes 1 hour to complete.
When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.
A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form.
It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed.
Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged.
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body.
First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found belowto its remaining ability scores.
The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1.
If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.
(If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can't be reincarnated).
This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.
It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class.
If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.
For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table.
For nonhumanoid creatures, the DM should create a similar table of creatures of the same type or simply choose the new form.
A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell.
Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated.
The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.
The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.
Refer to the Monster Manual for details.
A wish or a miracle spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form}}

Any time you are in a demanding situation (such as combat), you must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or take a &#8211; 2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks until the situation passes.
While in sandform, you have a base land speed of 20 feet.

The collapsing structure is also dangerous (see Cave-ins and Collapses, page 66 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

The wall can seal off a passage or breach, or be used to construct new walls.
A wall of salt is 1 inch thick per caster level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
You can form a wall of salt into nearly any shape desired.
The wall need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp.
If such a span is more than 20 feet long, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell's area by half.
For example, a 10th-level caster could create a salt span with a surface area of five 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth, by likewise reducing the area.
The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell or by chipping and breaking.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 3 hit points per inch and hardness 2.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 1 per inch of thickness.
Directing a constant blast of water at a wall of salt (for example, a geyser from a decanter of endless water) dissolves the mineral, dealing 10 points of damage per minute (which hardness does not reduce).
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of salt, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature's next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall.
Creatures can move through a wall of water by making Swim checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall.
Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location.

Spell Resistance: Yes
Ululations and nonsense syllables cascade from your mouth as you intentionally mispronounce your enemy's truename.
Your foe's flesh takes on a gelatinous state and starts to fuse together, forming a bloblike figure where your enemy once stood.
This spell functions as polymorph, except that you change the subject into a horrid form as its features melt into only marginally recognizable protoplasm.
The subject becomes an aberration with 10 Strength, 10 Dexterity, and 10 Constitution.
Its new form has a slam attack appropriate for a creature of its size (see Table 5-1 on page 296 of the Monster Manual), a speed of 20 feet, and no other extraordinary or supernatural abilities.
If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save.
If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, and loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability) for the duration of the spell.
Regardless of the second save, the subject still retains its class and level (or Hit Dice), as well as all benefits derived therefrom (such as base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points).
It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.
The subject has the same limbs it did before the warp truename spell, so it can still manipulate object and use equipment.
The subject can still speak, albeit in a gurgling, pained voice.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures have immunity to warp truename, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the personal truename of the creature you're trying to warp}}

As with a fireball, you point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the waterball is to burst.
A blue, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the waterball at that point.
(An early impact results in an early detonation).
If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as an arrow slit, you must &quot;hit&quot; the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
(See the fireball spell description in the Player's Handbook for details of the blast pattern).
When it detonates, the waterball deals 1d6 points of subdual damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
An affected creature can make a Reflex save for half damage.
Since the damage is subdual rather than energy, it is subject to damage resistance.
Objects take no damage unless they have a hardness of 0, in which case they take full damage.
If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the waterball may continue beyond it if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

When you cast this spell, an insidious rot immediately taints any wooden object or plant creature you touch. Any unattended nonmagical wooden item smaller than 6 feet in diameter, or a 3-foot-radius volume of a larger wooden object (such as a wooden door), is instantly destroyed by wood rot.
In combat, you can use the spell to attempt to sunder any wooden or wooden-hafted weapon; the weapon or its wooden portion is destroyed on a successful melee touch attack. Attempting to sunder a weapon generally provokes attacks of opportunity, and wood rot has no effect on wooden or wooden-hafted weapons that strike you, even if you hold the charge.
Against wooden shields or armor, you also make a melee touch attack. Such targets too large to be destroyed outright take a -1d6 penalty to their armor or shield bonus on a successful hit and are rendered unusable if the penalty exceeds the bonus. Any attack against a wooden object discharges the spell, and wooden magic items are immune to the effect of wood rot.
Against plant creatures, wood rot deals 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15) on a successful attack. Against plant creatures, the spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round. Once it is used to make an attack against a plant creature, wood rot cannot be used to attack or destroy wooden items.

The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2-2 in the **Dungeon Master's Guide**.  The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change.
The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.
<strong>Special: When casting **animal growth** as a Scalykind Domain spell, only ophidian and reptilian creatures are affected.</strong>
If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.  If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it&#8212;the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.
The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting}}

This spell can be cast only upon the Astral Plane (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 154). It opens up a small planar portal to a demiplane where natural healing can occur (unlike on the Astral Plane itself). The firm surface of the demiplane is roughly 50 feet square, and the demiplane extends 50 feet above the surface. The demiplane's traits (including time, gravity, and magic) match those of the Material Plane, and the demiplane is self-contained; walking to one end returns a character to the point from which he began. The demiplane has no unusual planar traits.
The only way in or out of the demiplane is through the entrance created by you, and only those named or described by you upon the casting of the spell can enter.

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds.
If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you.
However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden.
Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf.
Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.
Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.
Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.
Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid.
If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession.
If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.
Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours.
The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process.
Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment.
No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment.
This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.
Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.
Note:Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (for NPCs).
This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively}}

The spell's subject becomes maddened by terrible pangs of hunger, viewing all creatures as food sources.
The subject creature gains a new bite attack that does damage according to the creature's size:

If the creature already has a bite attack that deals more damage, use that damage value instead.
The subject creature eschews all other attacks or actions except for its new bite attack, but it defends itself normally. It moves to attack the nearest living creature it can get to and attacks this creature until it is dead or until another living creature is closer. The subject creature attacks whatever living creature is nearest, regardless of former allegiance or personal connection. If moving toward the nearest living creature would move the creature into a dangerous area (precarious footing, a huge fire, or a deadly trap is in the way) the subject creature moves around the hazard if it can or moves to attack another creature if moving around the hazard isn't possible. If such movement brings the subject creature closer to another living creature, it attacks that creature instead. If the subject of the spell cannot detect or get to a living creature nearby, it goes looking for one to attack}}

You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment.
For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of your alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposed alignment or an enemy faith.

The creature targeted by this spell immediately takes 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. This drain manifests as a hardening of the limbs and skin as the victim's flesh slowly turns to wood. Each day that passes, the victim takes an additional 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. Even if drained points are restored (through restoration, for example), the target creature still takes Dexterity drain each day until the spell is lifted.

Aside from radiating an aura of transmutation magic, the plant is a normal plant with no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores.
Jungle's rapture is a curse, and as such it cannot be dispelled. It can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if the caster level of that spell is equal to or higher than your caster level at the time you cast jungle's rapture}}

Phantom stags gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those associated with any lower caster levels.

Magical stone is not affected by the spell.
The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet.
A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC.
Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it.
Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.
If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet.
For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud.
Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet.
The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.
However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance&#8212;but not necessarily its form.
Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.
The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into a heap of sand.
Magical stone is not affected by this spell.
The depth of the sand created cannot exceed 10 feet.
If transmute stone to sand is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the sand falls to the floor and scatters in a pile 5 feet deep.
For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into sand.
Piling on the floor, this sand would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet.
The falling sand and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
Castles and large stone buildings generally have immunity to this spell, since transmute stone to sand can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.
However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
The sand remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute sand to stone spell restores its substance&#8212;though not necessarily its form.

Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.
(This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell).
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site.
The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect.
You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment.
For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of like alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposite alignment or an enemy faith.
At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement,
invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth.
Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects.

This spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand. The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.
Creatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level).
Creatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located.
Any open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished.

Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC.
Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation.
(Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall).
You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level.
This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action.
For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed).
For example, a creature that rolled 25 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round.
Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above.
A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside.
In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends.
Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.
A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons.
Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work.
Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.
Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants}}

When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a bulette (MM 30). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to magical beast, and your size changes to Huge. You have the space and reach of a bulette (15 feet/10 feet). You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution of an average bulette (Str 27, Dex 15, Con 20), but you retain your own mental ability scores. Your base land speed becomes 40 feet, and you gain a burrow speed of 10 feet. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You also gain low-light vision, scent, and tremorsense out to 60 feet.
Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base saving throw bonuses all remain the same. You lose any extraordinary special abilities of your own form, as well as spell-like and supernatural abilities. You keep all extraordinary special attacks derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage or a rogue's sneak attack), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels. You cannot speak or cast spells while in bulette form. However, if you have the Natural Spell feat, you can cast spells normally. Your natural armor bonus becomes +12, regardless of any natural armor bonus from your normal form. You can make two claw attacks, which are natural weapons that deal 2d8+8 points of damage. While in bulette form, you gain the bulette's leap extraordinary attack form, allowing you to make four claw attacks instead of two.

To succeed, you must make a DC 18 Will save.
The awakened sand is friendly toward you.
You have no special empathy or connection with sand you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desire to it.
The sand creature you awaken has the same statistics as a Huge animated object with a base land speed of 40 feet and a burrow speed of 20 feet.
Unlike normal animated objects, awakened sand beings have the earth subtype, and their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6.
A sand being has immunity to polymorphing.
The awakened sand can speak one language you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any) it has.
A sand creature can engulf Large or smaller creatures as a standard action.
It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs.
The sand creature merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover.
Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw.
Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the creature moves forward.
Engulfed opponents are considered grappled and are trapped within the sand creature's body.
The sand creature deals 1d6+3 points of damage to trapped opponents each round after the one in which it engulfed them.
Opponents that need to breathe risk suffocation (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
The save DC is Strength-based.
Sand creatures are amorphous and can do anything sand would be expected to do&#8212;hide perfectly atop other sand, form into dunes and drifts, and pour through small openings (although passing through an opening two size categories smaller than the creature takes a full-round action)}}

A successful Fortitude save allows the creature to move normally in that round.
In addition, the stifling winds dehydrate those within the cone. In each round when an affected living creature fails its saving throw, it takes 2 points of damage.

Each round as a standard action, you conjure a pillar of rock that bursts from a stone or earthen surface anywhere within the spell's range.
Each pillar fills a 5-foot square and grows to a height of 20 feet or until it hits a barrier such as a ceiling or wall.
A Large or smaller creature in a square where a pillar erupts must succeed on a Reflex save or be carried upward by the force of the pillar.
If a pillar is created in a room with a ceiling height of 20 feet or less, the rock slams into the ceiling, dealing 4d6 points of damage to any creature atop it.
In a location with a ceiling height of more than 20 feet, a creature carried up by a pillar must succeed on a DC 20 Balance check or fall from the top of the pillar when it reaches its maximum height.
On a failed check, the creature plummets to the ground, taking 2d6 points of damage from the fall.
You can also cause a pillar to erupt from a vertical surface, in which case any creatures in the pillar's path must succeed on their Reflex saves or take 2d6 points of damage and be knocked prone.

To cast greater call lightning, you must be in a stormy area&#8212;a rain shower, a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinn or air elemental of 7 HD or more), clouds and wind, or even hot and cloudy conditions will do.
While you are in such an area, you can call down one bolt of lightning every 5 minutes.
You need not do so immediately upon casting&#8212;other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed at any time during the spell's duration.
However, you must use a standard action to concentrate on the spell when you call each bolt.
Each bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke, striking any target point you designate that is within range (measured from your position at the time).
It takes the shortest possible unobstructed path between a nearby cloud and the target point.
Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the bolt's path or the point where it strikes is affected.
Each bolt deals 1d10 points of electrical damage per caster level (maximum 15d10).
Greater call lightning is usable only outdoors; it does not function indoors, underground, or underwater.

The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a maze spell.
Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale.
Thus, the subject could not find the way to &quot;a forest where a green dragon lives&quot; or &quot;a hoard of platinum pieces&quot;, but it could find the exit to a labyrinth.
The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take.
For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph of warding.
The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.
Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round.

A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target.
Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), divided up among the acorns as you wish.

Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface.
In addition to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet.
A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.
Holly Berry Bombs: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs.
The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet).
If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet.

A creature struck must succeed on a Reflex save or be encased in a 5-inch-thick sheath of ice and be immobilized (and this helpless). A creature encased in ice takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round until freed. A target encased in ice is aware and breathes normally but cannot speak or move other tan to attempt to escape by making a Strength check (see below). It can still execute purely mental actions, such as using a spell-like ability. A spellcaster can cast a spell with no verbal or somatic component as long as the spell lacks a focus or material component, or the material component, focus, or divine focus is already in the spellcaster's hand.
The ice blocks line of effect. A winged creature cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim but because ice floats, the encase swimmer will rise to the surface and bob about.
A DC 22 Strength check breaks the ice, freeing the encased creature. Creatures other than the target can also attack the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 15 hit points.

Edge of a Glacier: Ice rift causes a glacier's edge to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An ice rift cast at the top of a 100-foot glacier would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the glacier.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath rubble (see below).
Open Glacier: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.

Spells that affect wood (such as wood shape) do affect ironwood, although ironwood does not burn.
Using this spell with wood shape or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items.
Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts.
These items are freely usable by druids.
Further, if you make only half as much ironwood as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.
Material Component:Wood shaped into the form of the intended ironwood object}}

The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while liveoak is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree.
The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect.
Liveoak must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak.
A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak.
For instance, &quot;Attack any persons who come near without first saying 'sacred mistletoe'&quot; is an eleven-word trigger phrase that you could use at 11th level or higher.
The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant (see the Monster Manual).
At the DM's option, you can extrapolate statistics for a smaller tree from the treant statistics if you cast liveoak on a smaller oak.
If liveoak is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be.
If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root}}

Duration: Instantaneous

Spell Resistance: No
You create a landslide of mud and water, which crushes, buries, and mires those caught in its path.
The mud covers the area of the spell to a depth of about 10 feet (although it might fill low-lying areas or fail to cover high points in the area, at the DM's discretion).
Creatures within the spell's effect must make a Reflex save.
Those who fail take 8d6 points of damage and are buried (see Avalanches on page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Those who succeed take 3d6 points of damage and are not buried.
Creatures of the fire subtype who are actually aflame (such as salamanders, azers, and fire elementals) instead take 8d8 or 3d8 points of damage, respectively.
A creature who escapes burial ends up on top of the mudslide, mired in deep mud.
After the initial slide, the mudslide persists indefinitely, producing an area of deep bog (average depth 10 feet) until the water in it evaporates.
It requires 4 squares of movement to enter 1 square of deep bog, and running or charging are impossible in the area.
Underwater, the mudslide remains indefinitely, producing an area of deep muck.
It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square containing deep muck, the DC of Balance and Tumble checks increases by 5, and the DC of Move Silently checks increases by 2.
Aboveground, the mud normally dries out in 2 to 3 days.

Because of the disorientation, the subject doesn't realize it's headed in the wrong direction until it meaningfully interacts with its environment (by making an attack or manipulating an object such as a door, for example). For the duration of the spell, an affected creature must succeed on a Will save each round to move normally.

Duststorm Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level.
Wind speeds of less than severe are insufficient to carry suspended sand.
(Wind strength and related duststorm effects are briefly summarized below, with more detail found on page 16).
Each round on your turn, creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves or suffer the effects of being in the wind, as well as the effects of suspended grit.
A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage, and creates a duststorm with fine grains of sand that reduces visibility, smothers unprotected flames, and even chokes protected flames.
A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.
Wind of this speed creates a sandstorm that badly reduces visibility and deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open.
Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.
Wind of this speed creates a flensing sandstorm that severely reduces visibility and deals 1d3 points of lethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open.
A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees.
Tornado-force sandstorms are of the flensing variety}}

Creatures mired in the hot mud take 5d6 points of fire damage per round, while those completely submerged in the sludge take 10d6 points of fire damage per round.
Creatures atop the mud (such as those standing on straw) take 1d6 points of fire damage each round from hot steam.
Damage from boiling mud continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only 1d6 points of fire damage per round.
The transmuted material cools after a period of 1 round per caster level.
The number of dice of damage the mud deals is halved each round after this duration expires.
The transmuted rock remains as mud even after it cools.
It eventually dries into soil, as per transmute rock to mud.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of a mixture of clay, sulfur, and water}}

Creatures that succeed on the Reflex save can move through the area normally. Creatures that start their turn in the affected area must attempt another Reflex save or be affected by the spell.
A held creature can attempt a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to break free, and can also break free by dealing enough damage to destroy the arm. An arm has AC 15, hardness 8, and 15 hit points.

When you cast this spell, you create a huge wave of water that slams into one or more targets within range.

If such a source of water exists within the range of the spell, the spell creates a burst centered on a location you designate.

It is possible for a wave arising from a body of water to push characters into the water.
The wave puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames if they are carried by the target or located within the area and they are Large or smaller. If the wave hits a magical fire, those flames are targeted by a dispel magic effect as if you had cast the spell}}

The enhancement bonus provided by tortoise shell stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0.
Tortoise shell slows a creature's movement as if it were wearing heavy armor. An elf subject to tortoise shell, for example, would have a speed of 20 feet and could run only 60 feet per round.

It merges into adjoining rock surfaces, melting the rock at the point of connection to form a smooth bond.
The wall can seal off a passage or breach, but the intense heat causes flammable materials in contact with the wall of magma to catch fire instantly.
A wall of magma is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
You can shape a wall of magma into sheets and curves, but the molten wall cannot form domes or unsupported horizontal surfaces more than 5 feet across.
The wall need not be vertical but must rest upon a firm foundation; it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
The wall cannot hold complex forms such as crenellations.
It is possible (though difficult) to form the wall into a ring to enclose creatures, but they can avoid this with successful Reflex saves.
The wall sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet.
Unlike a wall of fire, both sides of a wall of magma radiate heat.
Since it is molten, the wall cannot be broken as such, but an object or creature could force its way through.
It costs 4 squares of movement to move through a square containing a wall of magma, but creatures of the earth subtype can pass through the wall at normal speed.
A wall of magma deals 5d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to creatures passing through it, the same amount each round to any creature within it, and 2d6 points of fire damage per round for 1d3 rounds after a creature leaves the area of the wall.
It deals double damage to undead and creatures with the water subtype.
The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell.
If any 5-foot section of the wall takes 40 points of cold damage or more in a round, that section hardens into normal stone (hardness 8, 15 hit points per inch of thickness), which can then be chipped or broken as normal (DC 20 Strength check, +2 per inch of thickness).
Do not divide cold damage by four, as normal for objects.
Casting create water on the surface of a wall of magma creates a cloud of steamy fog that fills a cube with the dimensions of the length of wall affected.
The fog dissipates after 10 minutes.
Only the surface of the stone hardens; the wall is not cooled completely.
Wall of magma can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent wall of magma that is chilled by cold damage stays solid for 10 minutes, then returns to its molten state}}

It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.
A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell's area by half.
Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

You can see and hear what occurs at a location, which can be at any distance on the same plane where you are located.
You must make a successful caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) to scry a specific location.
The difficulty of this check depends on how familiar you are with that location and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that place.
Furthermore, the difficulty to scry the desired locale increases if the location is extremely far removed, indoors or underground, or on another plane.
The DC of this check is 20 + any modifiers related to your knowledge of the area, your connection to it, and the location's distance, as set out in the following table.
If you fail this check, the scrying attempt simply fails.
If the caster level check succeeds, you create an invisible magical sensor in any location you desire.

1st Round: A storm of elemental fury buffets the area immediately beneath it with a whirling windstorm (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 94&#8212;95). Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible, and Small or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blown away. Medium creatures must make their Fortitude save or be knocked prone, and Large or larger creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save to move that round. Flying creatures that fail their saves are instead blown in a random direction, traveling 1d6×5 feet if Large or larger, 1d6×10 feet if Medium, and 2d6×10 feet if Small or smaller. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the storm of elemental fury's save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.
2nd Round: Chunks of rock fall from the sky, dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save) to all creatures in the storm.
3rd Round: A deluge of rain extinguishes unprotected flames and perhaps protected ones as well (50% chance). The torrential downpour reduces visibility to 5 feet and cuts movement in half.
4th Round: Flame pelts the area beneath the storm cloud, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) (Reflex half)}}

Waterspout causes water to rise up into a whirling, cylindrical column. You can direct the movement of the waterspout as a move action.
A waterspout moves at a speed of 30 feet. You can concentrate on controlling the waterspout's every movement or specify a simple program, such as move straight ahead, zigzag, circle, or the like. Directing a waterspout's movement or changing its programmed movement is a move action for you. A waterspout always moves during your turn in the initiative order. If the waterspout exceeds the spell's range, it collapses and the spell ends.
A waterspout batters creatures and objects it touches, and it often sucks them up. Any creature or object that comes in contact with it must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d8 points of damage. Medium or smaller creatures that fail their saves are sucked into the spout and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 2d6 points of damage each round (no save). Trapped creatures remain inside for 1d3 rounds before the waterspout ejects them out the top of the spout, and they fall back to the surface (taking 8d6 points of falling damage) 1d8×5 feet from the base of the waterspout.
Waterborne creatures or objects within 10 feet of the spout (below and on all sides) also must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked into the spout if they are Medium or smaller. Anything sucked into the spout takes 3d8 points of damage and is then trapped for 1d3 rounds as described above.
Only the smallest of watercraft, such as canoes, kayaks, or coracles, can be sucked into the spout. The occupant of any such craft can make a Profession (sailor) check instead of a Reflex save if it so chooses to avoid being sucked up}}

If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability.
Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent.
If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form.
Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form).
As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes.

The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below).
An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.
Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.
Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on hit points for walls and the like).
Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground.
Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.
Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand.
At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
Pinned beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.
If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead}}

The effect lasts for 1 round, although the water created by the spell does not disappear after 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground within the area cannot move or attack.
A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to successfully cast a spell.
The force of the water and debris deals those caught in the area 1d6 points of nonlethal damage plus another 1d6 points per five caster levels (maximum 4d6).
Any creature or object that is not soundly secured is pushed violently to the outer edge of the area.
If this forces the creature or object into a solid surface, it takes 8d6 points of damage.
A creature holding onto a sturdy object can make a DC 20 Strength check to avoid being moved.
A creature not already holding onto such an object can make a DC 20 Reflex save or Swim check to grab one.
A creature of Huge size or larger can make a DC 30 Strength check to dig in its feet and simply withstand the oncoming wave.
A creature that fails any of these checks falls prone in addition to being swept away.
The specific effect and aftereffects of a flashflood spell on the environment depend on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
When the spell is completed, a total volume of 100,000 cubic feet of water (400 5-foot squares, in a 120-ft. cone, 10 feet deep) is left behind.
This water behaves like ordinary water&#8212;draining away and leaving puddles in most cases, or perhaps forming a shallow lake or pond.
Unless the caster has taken care to create the flashflood in a cleared area, however, the water left behind is full of debris, dirt, and perhaps a few corpses.
Such water is unfit to drink.
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The sudden surge of water knocks down support beams, but otherwise has no real effect, aside from filling the tunnel with water to a depth of 10 feet.
If the area is insufficient to support 100,000 cubic feet of water, the water level rises above 10 feet until the entire volume is filled, or it spills outward from the confines of the original 400 squares.
What happens is based on the layout of the area.
In the case of level terrain, the water simply drains away over the course of a minute or so, leaving pools in depressions from which it cannot drain.
When the ground in a tunnel is not level, the water might flood sections of the tunnel.
In such cases, determine whether the flooded area is sufficient to contain the entire volume of water created&#8212;
and, if not, how deeply the water floods the next level up.
Any creatures caught in water over their heads might drown.
For example, Miyish casts flashflood in the dungeon of a ruined castle.
The dungeon's total volume is only 40,000 cubic feet (160 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling).
The remaining 60,000 cubic feet of water has to go somewhere, so it rushes up and out the entrance to the dungeon.
Since the terrain above the dungeon is another level of the castle, and is basically watertight, the water collects up here.
The total volume of this level is 80,000 cubic feet (320 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling), leaving 20,000 cubic feet of air.
Since the water has nowhere to go but up, and it has gone as high as it can, the water on this level is 7-1/2 feet deep (60,000 cubic feet divided by 8,000&#8212;the square footage of 320 5-foot squares).
If Miyish can't swim or breathe water, he has made a grave tactical error by casting flashflood in an area too small to contain it.
Cliffs: Casting flashflood at the base of a cliff has no effect on the cliff.
Casting flashflood from the top of a cliff can force creatures and objects over the edge, so that they take falling damage.
Open Ground: Creatures on open ground are safest from the worst effects of flashflood.
They might be knocked prone by the force of the water, or even swept 120 feet (24 squares) away, but they are not in any particular danger of drowning or being crushed.
Structure(s): Any structure standing on open ground takes 60 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden building, but not a structure built of stone, masonry, or reinforced masonry.
Hardness reduces this damage, but it isn't halved as damage dealt to objects normally is.
Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half).
The debris is swept away by the flashflood.
River, Lake, or Marsh: The river, lake, or marsh overflows its banks, though with rivers the effect is transitory.
In the case of lakes and marshes, determine how much the body of water overflows, given the 100,000 cubic feet of water added to it.
Only calculate this amount if the total surface area of the lake or marsh is less than 40,000 square feet&#8212;and even then, it's only academic unless it is important to determine whether something on the shore gets wet}}

The figure can emerge from the tree you touch, or from any tree of the same type within the spell's range.
Thereafter, if you and the forest child separate by more than the maximum range of the spell, or if you lose line of effect to it, it vanishes instantly and the spell ends.
A forest child mimics your actions, including speech, unless you direct it to act differently as a move action.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing in its location, and you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action anytime during your turn.
While you are using its senses, your own body is considered blinded and deafened.
If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the forest child instead of from you.
It cannot, however, cast any spells on itself.
Spells cast through the forest child function normally in all respects except for the point of origin.
A forest child has a number of hit points equal to your character level.
If you use it to attack physically, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, and it deals damage equal to your unarmed damage.
As a standard action, you can change places with your duplicate.
(Although the spell itself is a transmutation, this usage is a conjuration [teleportation] effect).
Making use of this option reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 5 rounds.
If you have fewer than 5 rounds of duration left, you cannot invoke this ability.

Air within the area freezes, resulting in a heavy snowstorm lasting for the duration of the spell.
Snow accumulates only if the ground temperature is below the moderate band.
Living creatures caught within the area when the spell is cast instantly turn to ice (as per the flesh to ice spell).
If a creature successfully saves, frostfell deals 1d6 points of frostburn damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
Creatures entering the area after the spell has been cast do not take this damage; however, all creatures in the area are subject to the normal effects of cold, snow, and ice for the duration of the spell.
Objects in the area, including those held by creatures, are instantly covered in a thin layer of frost, making them slippery.
When a creature uses a frosted item (a weapon, lockpicks, a potion, and so on), it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check or it drops the item before it can be used.
Cold spells cast within the area gain a +1 caster level.
Multiple frostfells may be cast in the same area to increase the effects (dropping the temperature by an additional 3 bands).

The glaciers remain stationary unless commanded, attacking any creatures within 5 feet with a +15 slam attack that deals 2d8+4 points of damage, plus 3d6 points of cold damage.
As a standard action, you may command any number of glaciers to move at a speed of 10 feet.
You cannot command any glacier to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any glacier, that glacier remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but it can be commanded again if you move with in 100 feet).
A glacier has 20 hit points per caster level and a hardness of 0.
Creatures can hit the glacier automatically.
Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt a glacier, and it deals full damage to the ice (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).

When the spell is initially cast, you take what is called the Form of the Hunter: your features undergo a subtle change, becoming more angular.
Your skin darkens to a blue-black hue and becomes slightly rough to the touch.
Your sense of smell sharpens, granting you the scent special ability and a +10 racial bonus to Survival checks for the purpose of tracking by scent.

If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends.
At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself when the spell strikes.
Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling.

You cannot pronounce an anathema against someone who is already dead.
Some deities do not allow an anathema to be pronounced against the innocent or against their chosen, while others grant their high-level clerics free use of this most terrible of divine curses.
An individual under anathema can no longer cast divine spells or call upon the power of his god to turn or command undead, heal, harm, smite, shape change, or use any other divine power associated with his character class.
An ordinary worshiper placed under anathema is not allowed to take advantage of any of the faith's services, such as healing, naming, marrying, or burial of the dead.
Anyone who dies while under anathema is barred from entry into his deity's plane just as though he had never declared allegiance to a god.
His soul is condemned to eternally writhe in the Wall of
the Faithless.
On a more personal level, the anathema spell marks the subject as accursed with regard to others of the faith.
They are not allowed to speak to him, look at him, or even acknowledge his existence.
The common members of the faith are only aware that the subject is under anathema if so informed by the church hierarchy; however, clerics, paladins, druids and rangers of the faith can automatically detect an anathema effect simply by looking at the subject.
The effect is permanent until lifted, either by the original spellcaster, or by a cleric of the same faith, of a higher level than the caster, who casts an atonement spell upon the subject.
The subject of an anathema can also remove its effect by changing his divine allegiance (see Changing Deities, page 233 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting).
Focus: The subject's name must be inscribed in a book or scroll especially consecrated for this purpose and detailing the crimes (real or imagined) for which the subject is being condemned.

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect.

Each creature within range of the gaze must attempt a saving throw against the gaze effect each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature can avert its eyes, which grants a 50% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants you concealment relative to it. A creature can close its eyes or turn away entirely; doing so prevents the gaze from affecting it but grants you total concealment from that creature.
In addition, you can actively attempt to use the gaze as a standard action each round. To do so, you choose a target within range, and that target must attempt a saving throw. A target that is averting or shutting its eyes gains the above benefits}}

The touched creature contracts the disease you have selected immediately (no incubation period) unless it makes a successful Fortitude save.
Unlike a creature affected by contagion, the subject of an epidemic spell becomes a powerful vector for spreading the disease.
As long as the subject is afflicted with the disease, any living creature (except the caster) within 30 feet of him or her must make a Fortitude save or immediately contract the disease, regardless of its usual incubation period or method of transmission.
Anyone infected in this manner also becomes a vector for the disease and can spread it in the same manner.
The save DC drops by 1 each day after the spell is cast, regardless of when any particular creature contracted it.
A creature that makes a successful Fortitude save against this particular epidemic cannot contract that disease by any means for one day.
Thereafter, coming within 30 feet of an infected creature requires another save, with the same consequences for failure or success.

You are never surprised or flat-footed.
In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself&#8212;duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on&#8212;and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.
This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature.
You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.
Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.
The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

Spaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth instead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/entangle--2807/">**entangle**</a> spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC).
<strong>Hill:</strong> Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effect of a shadow landscape spell. Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope. Cliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25 Climb check to ascend or descend.
<strong>Marsh:</strong> Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding. Half the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 88).
<strong>Mountain:</strong> The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds. Cliffs and chasms require a DC 25 Climb check to scale. Creatures who fail Climb checks or make loud  noises have a 10% chance of starting an avalanche (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 90). Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, and anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet.
<strong>Plain:</strong> Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent. Half the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/entangle--2807/">**entangle**</a> spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC).
<strong>Underground:</strong> Ordinary dungeons aren't affected by shadow landscape, but naturally occurring caverns are. Natural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10% of the available floor space.
In addition to terrain-specific effects, a shadow landscape spell worsens the weather within the spell's area. When rolling random weather (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 94), roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result. This effect does not apply underground.
You don't suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher Climb DCs, and so on) of a shadow landscape you created. When you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designated don't suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they're still subject to the bad weather.
You can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell's area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians. As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell's area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to cold 10, darkvision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and lowlight vision. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value}}

The spheres dissipate after dealing this damage.

(See the meteor swarm spell description in the Player's Handbook for details on the patterns).
Large Spheres: Each large sphere has a 15-foot-radius spread and deals 4d8 points of electricity damage.
The four spheres explode with their points of origin forming either a large diamond or a large box pattern (your choice) around the spell's central point of origin.
The blasts are 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, creating overlapping areas of the spell's effect and exposing the center to all four blasts.
Small Spheres: Each small sphere has a 7 1/2-footradius
spread and deals 2d6 points of electricity damage.

You transform natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of red-hot molten lava.

Creatures that fail their saves, or those unable to escape the area, take 20d6 points of fire damage in each round they remain in the area. Creatures in the lava have their speed reduced to 5 feet and take a &#8212;2 penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class. Even after leaving the area of the spell, creatures that were exposed to the lava take half damage (either 3d6 or 10d6) for 1 additional round.
If transmute rock to lava is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the lava falls to the floor and spreads out in a 15-foot-radius pool at a depth of approximately 1-1/2 feet. The rain of lava deals 2d6 points of fire damage to anyone caught directly beneath (Reflex half). In addition, creatures take 10d6 points of fire damage each round when they are caught in the area of the pool.
Although constructions of worked stone can't be targeted with this spell, casting it on unworked stone below or adjacent to such structures deals 10d6 points of fire damage per round to any part of the structure in contact with the lava. Wooden structures in contact with lava instantly burst into flame.
The lava cools naturally from its surface toward its center, and it no longer deals fire damage after 2d6 hours as it slowly reverts to stone. Though a 15-foot-radius pool can take as long as two days to completely cool, the core of a 10-foot cube of lava might remain molten for a month or more.
Magical or enchanted stone is not affected by the spell}}

These forces of pure elemental power gather together a wall of water that moves inexorably in the direction of your choice, crushing all that it encounters.**
This spell creates a towering tsunami and sends it forth in a powerful wave to smash all in its path. The tsunami starts at any point you select within range of the spell and then moves at a speed of 60 feet in any direction chosen by you. Once the direction is set, the tsunami cannot change course. The tsunami deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all in its path. Anything struck can make a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Gargantuan or larger creatures that fail the save are knocked prone. Huge or smaller creatures that fail the save are picked up and carried with the wave. Each round a victim is carried by the tsunami, it takes the bludgeoning damage again and can make an additional Fortitude save for half damage. Creatures being carried by a tsunami cannot move in any other way. They can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in a tsunami take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. They can escape the wave by making successful DC 20 Swim checks, as long as they end their movement outside the effect of the tsunami.
Any creature that comes in contact with a tsunami as a result of movement during its turn is considered to have been struck by the tsunami's movement. A creature can attempt to extract another creature caught by a tsunami, providing the rescuer resists being swept up or knocked down by the tsunami and can reach the victim. Extracting a victim in this manner requires a DC 20 Strength check. 
A tsunami's progress can be halted by anything that would normally block line of effect along its path, assuming the tsunami does not destroy the intervening object or creature. If only a portion of the tsunami is blocked, the rest of it continues on.
Although this spell can be cast on dry land, it is most effective when cast on the open sea. In this case, saving throws to avoid full damage are made with a -4 penalty, and the width of the tsunami increases to 40 feet per caster level.

This spell is a more potent version of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/whirlwind--2661/">**whirlwind**</a> (PH 301). A greater whirlwind affects creatures differently, depending on their size and where they are in relation to the twister.
Near the Tornado: Large or smaller creatures who start their turn within 60 feet of the center of a greater whirlwind must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dragged 1d4×10 feet toward the center of the twister, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet dragged.
Huge creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Gargantuan and Colossal creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save before moving away from the twister.
Flying creatures of Huge size or smaller that fail their Fortitude saves are sucked to the center of the twister, taking 2d6 points of damage from the battering and buffeting. Gargantuan flying creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be pulled 1d6×10 feet toward the center of the twister. Colossal flyers must likewise make Fortitude saves or be pulled 1d6×5 feet toward the twister's center.
Any Huge or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Large or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds. Any creature picked up is ejected 3 rounds later.
Inside the Tornado: Creatures that start their turn inside the tornado take 6d6 points of damage for each round they remain inside at the beginning of your turn. Creatures inside the tornado can't do much; attacks, spellcasting, and movement are impossible within a greater whirlwind. When the greater whirlwind ejects a creature, it reappears 4d6×5 feet away from the twister's center in a random direction, and 4d6×5 feet off the ground (immediately falling if it can't fly).
Terrain and Structures: The tornado uproots trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of dense rubble (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 90) wherever it goes. Structures within a greater whirlwind take 2d6×10 points of damage per round. In a round or two, that amount of damage is sufficient to destroy any building made of materials less sturdy than reinforced masonry.
No ranged attacks can pass through the twister. A greater whirlwind extinguishes all flames it touches. Listen checks are impossible within a greater whirlwind.
A greater whirlwind remains stationary unless you direct it elsewhere as a move action. It moves up to 60 feet per round}}
