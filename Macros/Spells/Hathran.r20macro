Light from a moonbeam spell does not adversely affect creatures that are sensitive to light, but lycanthropes in humanoid form caught in the cone must make a Will save to avoid involuntarily assuming their animal forms. A lycanthrope in animal form can change out of it on the creature's next turn (spending a round in animal form). However, if it is still in the area of the spell, it must succeed on  a Will save to do so. Once a lycanthrope successfully saves against moonbeam, it is not affected by any more of your moonbeam spells for 24 hours.
Moonbeam penetrates any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but does not counter or dispel it. Darkness spells of higher level block a moonbeam.

You call a swordlike beam of moonlight into your hand. Anyone who can cast moon blade can wield the beam with proficiency. However, if you are proficient with any type of sword, you can wield the beam as if it were any type of sword and thus gain the benefits of any special sword skill you might have, such as Weapon Focus.
Attacks with a moon blade are melee touch attacks. Its strike saps vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds but dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (to a maximum of +10) to any type of creature except undead. Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade. Their substance boils away from its touch, and they take 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +20) per blow. The blade is immaterial, and your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage.
A successful moon blade strike temporarily scrambles magic. On the target's next turn after a hit from a moon blade, the creature must make a Concentration check to use any spell or spell-like ability. The DC is equal to 10 + damage dealt + spell level. (An opponent hit by a moon blade while casting a spell must make the usual Concentration check to avoid losing the spell in addition to the check on its next turn.)

You can bring one additional creature per caster level with you into the land womb. All creatures to be brought into the land womb must be touching each other (for instance, holding hands in a ring).
Land womb creates an underground space large enough to hold all target creatures. While space is tight, spellcasting by targets is still possible while in the confines of the spell's effect. You can no longer hear or see anything on the surface by nonmagical means.
You can end the spell at will, but those who are with you cannot. At the end of the spell's duration, all within the land womb return to the spot where they stood before the spell took effect}}


Moon Path(Spell Compendium): - Hathran(5)
	/w gm &{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name}}} {{subtags=casts [Moon Path](https://dndtools.net/spells/spell-compendium--86/moon-path--4578/) }} {{School:= Evocation  [Force]}} {{Level:= **Hathran 5**, NentyarHunter 5, Moon 5}} {{Components:= V, S, M, DF}} {{Material Component:= A white handkerchief}} {{Range:= Medium ([[100+floor(@{casterlevel2})*10]] ft)}} {{Effect:=A variable-width, glowing white stair or bridge of translucent force up to 15 ft./level long; see text}} {{Duration:=1 minute/level (D)}} {{Savingthrow:=None; see text }} {{Save DC:=[[@{spelldc5}+@{sf-Evocation}]]}} {{Spellresistance:=No }}  {{compcheck=Concentration: [[ {1d20+ [[ @{concentration} ]] }>[[?{Damage Taken|0}+15+0]] ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Success! @{subjective} casts @{possessive} spell!}} {{failcheck=@{subjective} fails @{possessive} concentration :( }} {{notes=**As you cast this spell, pure, pale moonlight shapes itself into a stair or bridge, as you desire.**
Moon path allows you to create a stair or bridge from one spot to another. The effect is a railless ribbon of glowing white translucent force like a glass strip. The strip can be from 3 to 20 feet wide as you decide. (You can vary the width over the ribbon's length if you want.) It sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are in midair.
At the time of casting, you designate up to one creature per caster level to receive extra protection while standing on or moving along the moon path. Protected creatures gain the benefit of a sanctuary effect. This functions like the 1st-level spell **sanctuary** except that the save DC is 15 + your Wis modifier, and any subject of the spell who attacks breaks the sanctuary effect for all subjects. Protected creatures also stick to the top of the moon path as though they have received spider climb spells. A creature loses both benefits immediately when it leaves the path.
Unlike a **wall of force**, a moon path can be dispelled. It is otherwise similar to a wall of force in that it needs no supports and it is immune to damage of all kinds. A disintegrate spell blasts a hole in the path 10 feet square, leaving the rest of the path intact. (If the moon path is 10 feet wide or less, this merely creates a 10-foot gap.) A hit from a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction destroys a moon path. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a moon path, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures. Gaze attacks cannot operate through a moon path. 
A moon path must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed. If its surface would be interrupted by any object or creature, the spell fails. The bridge version of the spell must be created flat. The stair version cannot rise or descend any more sharply than 45 degrees}}

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward.
The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated.
If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.
The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw.
If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell.
If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).
The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier).
It can try each method once per day.
If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.
A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel.
You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil, page 246) to make the trap more secure.
If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare.
You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward.
You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check.
The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward.
If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service.
New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours.
This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell.
Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.
If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.
Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.
The creature might later seek revenge.
If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as &quot;Wait here&quot; or &quot;Defend this area against attack&quot;), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.
Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
For example, lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental}}
