A fire trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth).
When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center.
When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center.
The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.
A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap.
An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.
Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast.
Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.
Note:Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a fire trap and Disable Device to thwart it.

A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture and low walls.

It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size.
The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame.
It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles.
A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks).
If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.
Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.

You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the **fireball** at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must &quot;hit&quot; the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
The **fireball** sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

Spell resistance does not apply to the damage dealt, but a creature's damage reduction does apply.  The blades are treated as magic, silvered, and slashing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles.
Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19.

Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage.
The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.
Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles.
Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.

Acorn Grenades: As many as four acorns turn into special splash weapons that can be hurled as far as 100 feet.
A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target.
Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), divided up among the acorns as you wish.
For example, a 20th-level druid could create one 20d6 missile, two 10d6 missiles, one 11d6 and three 3d6 missiles, or any other combination totalling up to four acorns and 20d6 points of damage.
Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface.
In addition to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet.
A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.
Holly Berry Bombs: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs.
The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet).
If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet.
A creature in the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage.

An elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8).

This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level.
Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice.

The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more.
The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack.
A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.
The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below).
An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.
Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.
Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on hit points for walls and the like).
Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground.
Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.
Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand.
At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
Pinned beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.

However, any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall.
The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.
Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.
The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a Mordenkainen's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.
Prismatic wall can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select.
The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.
If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor.
Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and receives no saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below).
If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space.
You may aim more than one meteor at the same target.
Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each.
(Fire resistance applies to each sphere's damage individually)}}

The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum.
The sphere's blindness effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4&#215;10 minutes.
You can pass into and out of the prismatic sphere and remain near it without harm. However, when you're inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.
Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on.
The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a prismatic wall.
Prismatic sphere can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
