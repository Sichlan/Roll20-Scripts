As you intone the spell, the script appears on a sheet of paper close at hand.
You cause writing from one source (such as a book) to be copied into a book, paper, or parchment. This spell copies 250 words per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell copies only nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook, a spell scroll, or a sepia snake sigil). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with explosive runes), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied.
The spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied.
Blank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If the target has  multiple pages, the spell automatically turns to the next blank page whenever necessary. If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of
blank pages. At any time during the spell's duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another  target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages. 
The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy}}

(Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Based on an assessment of your immediate surroundings and chosen path of travel, you receive one of three visions that reflect the next hour's journey: safety, peril, or great danger.
The base chance for receiving an accurate reply is 70% +1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly.
If the omen of peril is successful, you get one of three visions, which lasts just a second or two.
<ul><li>Safety: You aren't in any immediate danger. If you continue on your present course (or remain where you are if you have been stationary for some time before casting the spell), you will face no significant monsters, traps, or other challenges for the next hour or so.</li></ul><ul><li>Peril: You will face challenges typical of an adventure: challenging but not overwhelming monsters, dangerous traps, and other hazards for the next hour or so.</li></ul><ul><li>Great Danger: Your very life is at grave risk. You will likely face powerful NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour.</li></ul>If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don't necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly.
Choosing which vision is &quot;correct&quot; takes some educated guesswork on the part of the DM, who should assess the characters' likely courses of action and what dangers they're likely to face.
The exact form that an omen of peril takes depends on whether you worship a specific deity, venerate nature as a druid, or simply uphold abstract principles. A druid might see a white dove for safety, a dark cloud obscuring the sun for peril, and a forest fire for great danger. A cleric of Fharlanghn might get a vision of a straight road for safety, a crossroads for peril, and a washed-out bridge for great danger.
Unlike the more powerful <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/augury--2478/">**augury**</a> spell (PH 202), an omen of peril doesn't respond to a specific question. It indicates only the level of danger likely for the next hour, not what form the danger will take.

First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.
Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

With a sizzle and a flash, those within the spell's radius disappear, then reappear somewhere nearby.
The scramble true position spell can wreck an enemy's carefully constructed defenses or highly regarded plan of attack by randomly moving them around.
You can't control where your enemies reappear, but they might fall off a precipice or wind up between your rogue and fighter allies.
When you cast the spell, make a single Truespeak check.
Then compare your result to the DC to move each creature: 15 + (2 x CR).
If you meet or exceed the DC for a creature, move that creature 2 squares in a random direction using the &quot;targeted on square&quot; part of the diagram on page 158 of the Player's Handbook.
The scramble true position spell can't send a creature into a square occupied by solid matter or another creature, but it can send a creature into a dangerous place (into lava or off a cliff, for example).
Make the comparison and movement in descending CR order.
If multiple targets have the same CR, the caster chooses the order in which to relocate them.
If you can't move a target 2 squares in a particular direction, move it 1 square, or it disappears and reappears in the same square if relocation is impossible.
Having their true locations disrupted with this spell can be disorienting for the subjects.
Every creature that you move with this spell (even those who reappear in the same square they started in) must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the truenames for cardinal directions and movement, which you learn with the spell.
This check has no set DC, but if your Truespeak check result is lower than 15 + (2 x creature's CR) for the lowest CR creature in the area, then scramble true position has no effect}}

You are able to hold the charge for one touch spell per arm of your body as long as you don't use a changed limb to cast another spell or touch anything with it. Each touch spell you cast resides in a different forelimb. For the duration of this spell, any touch spells you cast are discharged only if you cast another spell with that forelimb or touch something with that forelimb.
For example, a human sorcerer casts this spell, then casts chill touch and holds the charge in his left hand, then casts shocking grasp and holds the charge in his right hand. Because of the spell flower, he can hold the charge on both of these spells at the same time. If he casts another spell with a somatic component (which requires the use of one of his hands), he immediately loses one of his held touch  spells (his choice), but if the spell he casts is also a touch spell, he can immediately hold the charge in the available hand. If he chooses to attack with a touch spell, it works normally. Since he has multiple limbs that are considered armed, he can make an off-hand attack with the other touch spell in the same round, with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons (PH 160).
A marilith spellcaster could do the same as the sorcerer in the previous example, except that she could  hold the charge on up to six touch spells. She could also use any of her spell-like or supernatural  bilities, since those do not interfere with holding a charge.
If the spell flower effect ends, the most recent touch spell cast remains as a held charge and all other held spells dissipate}}

This spell imbues the caster with an ability to heal minor wounds that lasts throughout the day. When you cast this spell, you store healing energy within your own form that can then be used to heal a number of hit points equal to twice your caster level (maximum 10 hp). You may choose to divide this healing among multiple recipients, and you don't have to use it all at once. Delivering healing with this spell requires a touch (a standard action) but does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
The effects of multiple touch of Jorasco spells do not stack, meaning that you can only store healing energy from one such spell at a time. If you cast the spell again before discharging all of the healing from a previous casting, the new total simply replaces the earlier one, effectively ending the previous spell.
As with all healing spells, touch of Jorasco deals damage to undead creatures. Using the spell in this way requires a successful melee touch attack but doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds).

The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll.
It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks.

The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly. The DM may determine that a question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the **augury** succeeds, you get one of four results:
<ul><li>Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).</li><li>Woe (for bad results).</li><li>Weal and woe (for both).</li><li>Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).</li></ul>If the spell fails, you get the &quot;nothing&quot; result.

You create an aura of blue mist that protects you against fire, absorbing the first 10 points of fire damage as a resist energy (fire) spell (PH 272). In addition to the resist energy (fire) effect, the spell can be used to snuff out fires.
Any nonmagical flame that the aura contacts is immediately extinguished if the flame's maximum damage is 10 or fewer points per round. This means that torches, small fires, and hurled alchemist's fire are snuffed out and cause no damage if used against you or if you touch them.
You can use a standard action to touch an existing magical fire (such as a flaming sphere or a wall of fire) and attempt to dispel it as if using a dispel magic spell against it (use the caster level of aura against flame for the caster level check). If you succeed, you take no damage from the touch and the magical fire and aura both vanish. If you fail, you take damage from the magical fire source normally (reduced by your aura against flame), and both spells remain.
With a readied action, you can use the aura as a dispel magic effect to counterspell a magical fire attack against you. If successful, the spell is counterspelled and the aura disappears. If you fail the dispel check, or if the attack is not a fire attack, the aura remains}}

In a moment you're safe, and you gain a brief respite&#8212;time enough to cast more permanent protective spells.**
You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 150).
Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows a character to breathe water on a water-dominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by avoid planar effects can't be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character's full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don't deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects.
In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects. In the D&amp;D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane.
The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades).
The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won't protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane}}

For every set of limbs fused into the primary set of limbs, the creature gains +4 to strength when using those fused limbs (affecting activities that would use those limbs, but not activities relying on its bite, legs, and so on). For example, a girallon under the effect of this spell would have one pair of arms and Strength 26 for the purpose of using those arms. A behir, which has three pairs of limbs that it can use as arms, would end up with one pair of arm-limbs with a +8 bonus to Strength for those arms (its six legs would be unaffected).
The loss of limbs might reduce the number of attacks available to the subject.

While within this extradimensional space, you can see the origin and destination locations, though the images are blurry (much like viewing the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane).
Dispel magic or gate seal traps you within the extradimensional space for as long as the portal is negated or sealed (as would surrounding both ends with a dead magic area).

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a  flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. 
Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.
A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). 
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time.
The weapons associated with each deity or alignment are as follows.
**Boccob:** Quarterstaff, &quot;Staff of Boccob&quot;

(A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).
Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of **animate dead**.  (The <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/desecrate--2604/">deserate</a> spell doubles this limit; see page 218).

**Skeletons:** A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.

**Zombies:** A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

This spell protects those within its area against a single named foe, doing so in three ways.
First, the area is forbidden to the creature.
It must make a successful Will save to enter it by any means (movement, teleportation spells, and so on).
If it fails its Will save and was endeavoring to use a teleportation spell to enter the area, it is shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 10 feet of the protected area.
If no free space is available within 10 feet, the spell simply fails.
The creature can try to enter the area only once during its turn, but can continue to try on subsequent rounds.
Even if the named creature gets inside the barrier, the other aspects of the spell function normally.
Second, all creatures within the area gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from the named creature, and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws required by the named creature's spell effects and special attacks.
Third, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess or exercise mental control over those within the spell's area by the named creature, including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant ongoing control over the subject.
Bane of the archrival suppresses these effects for the duration of the spell or as long as the subject remains within the spell's area.

The spell will detect everything from a vein of iron ore to a pile of gold coins, even through solid stone or other barriers.
When you cast this spell, you must concentrate on at least 10 pounds of the metal or mineral you're searching for.
If an accumulation of that metal 10 pounds or larger is within the spell area, you will unerringly sense it (most coins are 50 to the pound).
The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area:
1st Round: Presence or absence of the particular metal or mineral.
2nd Round: Approximate weight of the metal or mineral.
3rd Round: Distance and direction (measured in a straight line) to the metal or mineral.
As long as the spell is active, you can change the metal or mineral you're trying to detect by simply concentrating on a different sample (it takes a standard action to refocus on the new sample).
Thus you could search for gold, then switch to adamantine, then seek out sources of iron.
If you stop concentrating on a sample, the spell ends.
If your sample is unworked, you will detect only unworked accumulations of the metal, such as ore deposits and mineral veins.
You will only detect worked metal, such as gold coins or mithral armor, if your sample is likewise refined.
Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area.
The spell can penetrate any nonmagical solid barrier.

Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect.

You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

In addition, a dragonmarked weapon's hardness increases by 50% for the spell's duration.
A mundane weapon under the effect of this spell is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.

When you cast this spell, you release a great burst of energy that deals 1d8 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). The blast of flame sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. If an interposing barrier shatters or breaks due to damage from this spell, the blast of heat may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any spell does.
Mindset: The energies you manipulate while preparing this spell cause an intense heat to well up within you. Although it doesn't harm you, this heat makes your unarmed strikes, natural weapon attacks, and melee attacks with metallic weapons deal 1 point of fire damage in addition to their normal damage. This heat dissipates when the spell is cast}}

A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.
You set the conditions of the ward.
Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores.
Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind (such as aberration, drow, or red dragon).
Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion.
They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level.
Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally.
Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area.
However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.
When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil.
A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage.
When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.
Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled.
Mislead, polymorph, and nondetection (and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't.
Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check.
Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).
The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to you depend on your deity.
He or she might also make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.
Note:Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding.
Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.
Blast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her.
This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting).
Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage.
Spell resistance applies against this effect.
Spell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know.
All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph.
If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder.
If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect (such as a cloud), the area or effect is centered on the intruder.
If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack.
Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph}}

Any creature passing through the haze takes 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4), with no save allowed.
If you conjure haboob so that it appears where creatures are located, each creature takes damage as if passing through the haze.
Such creatures take half damage with a successful Reflex save, but if these creatures do not leave the affected area at their next opportunity, they take full damage from the abrading sands (no save) as if they had voluntarily entered the area.

You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class.
When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description.
The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is.
Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it.
If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct feasible route.
The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of asmuch as 240 feet per round.
Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears.
The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you.
If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears.
If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate you.
If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature.
If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.

This spell creates a battleaxe-shaped formation of jagged, fast-swirling ice shards in your hand. You are automatically considered proficient with the **ice axe**. Attacks with the **ice axe** are melee touch attacks. The axe deals 2d12 points of cold damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) with a successful hit. You cannot be disarmed of the **ice axe** nor can it be sundered. Since the axe is virtually weightless, your Strength modifier does not apply on damage rolls. If your base attack bonus is high enough to allow for multiple attacks in a round, you can make them with the **ice axe**.
If  you  choose  to  hold  something other than the **ice axe** in your hand or use the hand in some other way, the **ice axe** vanishes until the hand is empty again.
Material Component: A shard of ice, glass, or crystal}}

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw.
A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation.
Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast.
The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.
Typical suggestions include &quot;Close the book and leave&quot;, &quot;Forget the existence of the book&quot;, and so forth.
If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear.
The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.

Casting the spell takes a standard action, during which you touch the creature you intend to communicate with. That creature should be able to understand a language you know (otherwise, when the magic is activated, the creature knows that you sent the message, but has no idea what the message is). At any time afterward, you can send your interplanar message to that creature.
The message pops into the target's mind, awake or asleep, and the target is aware that the message has been delivered. If the message arrives when the target is asleep, it might appear as a vivid dream that the target remembers upon awakening.
This spell does not obligate nor force the creature you communicate with to act. The target cannot reply to tell you its plans or intentions. The message travels through the Astral Plane to reach its target, so the spell cannot reach planes separate from (not coterminous to or coexistent with) the Astral Plane.

brief moment before it flashes and fills the area of effect with a pulse of cerulean light.
Any aberration within the area must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the following ill effects.
Closer aberrations are affected first.
Each effect lasts for 1 round.
None: The aberration suffers no ill effect, even if it fails the
saving throw.
Sickened: The aberration takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round.
Nauseated: The aberration cannot attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything but take a single move action for 1 round.
Dazed: The aberration can take no actions, but has no penalty to its Armor Class, for 1 round.
Stunned: The aberration drops everything held, can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round.

You see luminous words appear in the air above your spell's target. The words describe the creature's strengths or weaknesses, as you desire.**
You gauge the strengths and weaknesses of an opponent to gain combat advantages. Upon casting this spell, you learn a number of strengths or weaknesses of the target equal to one, plus one strength or weakness per two caster levels (maximum four). You can choose to learn strengths, weaknesses, or some combination thereof that you specify. If a creature has more strengths or weaknesses than you can learn with a single casting, you learn the most powerful ones first. Thus, if a monster can use finger of death at will and has resistance to sonic 5, you would learn about finger of death first.
Strengths can include attack forms and special abilities (including spell-like abilities or supernatural abilities). Weaknesses include vulnerability to an energy type.
For example, suppose a 7th-level cleric casts know opponent on a black-armored warrior, choosing to learn one strength and two weaknesses. The warrior fails his save, and the DM informs the cleric's player that the opponent has the ability to drain energy (a strength), is adversely affected by sunlight, and can be repelled by a holy symbol (both weaknesses).

Vulnerabilities include anything that causes the creature more than the normal amount of damage (such as a creature with the cold subtype having vulnerability to fire or a crystalline creature's susceptibility to the shatter spell). Resistances include any effects that reduce or negate damage the creature takes and immunities to particular attacks. The spell identifies resistances and vulnerabilities granted by spell effects.
For example, if cast upon a balor, you learn that it has damage reduction 15/cold iron and good; spell resistance 28; immunity to poison, fire, and electricity; resistance to acid 10 and cold 10; and that it does not have any particular vulnerabilities}}

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it.
A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward.
When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle.
The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries.
If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.
A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap.
If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends.
The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can.
If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day.
If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.
A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.
You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.
If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does.
The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can.
The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure.
Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check.
The DM makes this check secretly.
If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective.
You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.
This task also takes 10 full minutes.
If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell.
The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level.
A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.
If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5.
The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&#8212;even a straw laid across it.
However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.
This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa}}

Each time the warded creature is struck by a positive energy effect, it rolls 1d20 + caster level against a DC of 11 + the HD of the originator of the effect.
For example, the DC for the level check would be 19 if an 8th-level cleric were trying to turn someone with positive energy protection.

The spell or effect does not function, and if the source of the positive energy effect was touching the warded creature, the source takes 2d6 points of damage.
If the warded creature fails the level check, then the positive energy effect occurs normally.
This spell may be placed on undead creatures, effectively allowing them an better chance to avoid the effects of a good cleric's turning ability.
First, determine how many creatures would be turned
normally.
Those who are potentially turned get level checks to avoid the effect.

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct direction to a place of safety, with safety being defined as a location where the individual is not taking immediate damage from the environment, and immediate damage is not imminent. It does not provide the means for the subject to move in that direction.
A safety spell points out the shortest distance out of a poisonous cloud, or the direction one should dig to reach the surface if entombed in earth. It does not function against the maze spell, because that spell deals no physical damage. Nor does the spell provide knowledge of or protection against the creatures that inhabit those safe places.
In the D&amp;D cosmology (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 150), safety has the following effects when cast on specific planes:
<strong>Plane of Shadow:</strong> Shortest route out of darklands.
<strong>Elemental Plane of Air:</strong> Nearest windproof shelter, shortest route out of smoke bank.
<strong>Elemental Plane of Earth:</strong> Nearest air pocket or open cavern.
<strong>Elemental Plane of Fire:</strong> Shortest route out of magma pools or other unusually hot places.
<strong>Elemental Plane of Water:</strong> Nearest pocket of breathable air; shortest route out of hot spot, ice  pocket, or red tide.
<strong>Negative Energy Plane:</strong> Nearest doldrum area with the minor negative-dominant trait.
<strong>Positive Energy Plane:</strong> Nearest edge zone with the minor positive-dominant trait.
<strong>Limbo:</strong> Nearest area of stabilized limbo.
<strong>Pandemonium:</strong> Nearest shelter from a windstorm.
<strong>Carceri:</strong> Shortest route out of a Minethys sandstorm.
<strong>Gehenna:</strong> Nearest flat ledge, nearest shelter from Mungoth's acidic snow.
<strong>Nine Hells:</strong> Nearest shelter from fireballs on Avernus, rockslides on Malbolge, or cold on Cania.
<strong>Acheron:</strong> Nearest shelter from Ocanthus bladestorms.
On planes you create yourself, safety might provide other information.
This spell is mostly used in hostile environments, such as one of the Inner Planes, to locate the nearest  pocket of habitable space.
If safety is cast and then followed by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/plane-shift--2423/">**plane shift**</a> spell (PH 262), the plane shift sends the subject of safety to a place of relative safety on that plane. It is transported to a pocket of air on the Elemental Plane of Water, for example, or a cool spot on the Elemental Plane of Fire}}

It loses its immunity to effects that require a Fortitude save, as well as its invulnerability to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects. However, an undead affected by this spell gains a bonus on its Fortitude saves equal to its Charisma bonus (if any). (The bonus doesn't apply to Fortitude saves against effects that also affect objects.) It must breathe, eat, and sleep just like a normal living creature (though the last two aren't likely to come into play thanks to the spell's short duration).
While it is under the effect of this spell, both negative energy (such as inflict spells) and positive energy (such as cure spells) heal damage to the undead creature, rather than damaging it.

This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive.

A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.
In addition, any attack by the creature that would normally include poison (such as a spider's bite) does not do so, but all other effects associated with that attack apply.
For example, if an aranea subject to spiderbind cast a touch spell and then bit a creature, the attack would deal normal bite damage and trigger the touch spell, but the bite would not inject poison.

Any effect that deals electricity damage (such as a lightning bolt or a blue dragon's breath weapon) that passes within 30 feet of the storm shield is attracted to it and strikes the shield instead of its intended target.
In the case of area spells such as lightning bolt, this redirection occurs if any portion of the spell's area is within 30 feet of the storm shield.
In such a case, the entire effect is drawn to the storm shield,
and all creatures or objects that otherwise would have been in the spell's area remain unharmed.
The storm shield takes full damage (no saving throw) from any effect drawn into it.
The shield can absorb up to 20 points of electricity damage per caster level before dissipating.
Any remaining damage is applied to all creatures within 10 feet of the storm shield's position (Reflex half; spell resistance applies).
For example, suppose a storm shield cast by a 5th-level cleric has already absorbed 78 points of electricity damage when it is struck by a lightning bolt that deals 45 points of damage.
The first 22 points of damage is enough to destroy the storm shield, so every creature within 10 feet of it takes 23 points of electricity damage (or 11 with a successful save).

You cause a weapon to gain the ability to deal energy damage in addition to its other abilities, similar to how a flaming burst weapon deals extra fire damage on a hit or a critical hit. The weapon can deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, chosen by you at the time of casting. The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of that energy type on a successful hit. On a critical hit, the weapon deals an additional 1d10 points of energy damage. If the weapon's critical multiplier is Ã—3, add 2d10 points of energy damage instead, and if the multiplier is Ã—4, add 3d10 points of energy damage.
This spell can be cast on a weapon that already deals energy damage, and if the weapon already creates the same type of damage as the spell, the effects stack.

This spell fuels the Dracorage for a short period.
It causes the target to instantly and fully succumb to the Dracorage, shifting the target's attitude toward nondragons to hostile and instilling in the dragon a bloodthirsty desire to murder and wreak havoc.
This usually causes the dragon (even a good metallic dragon) to immediately attack all nondragons nearby.
Because aggravate Dracorage manipulates the existing Dracorage mythal, the Will save against the spell is 4 higher than normal and has a DC of 18 + the appropriate ability modifier.
(Nevertheless, many casters of the spell will use subterfuge to trick the target dragon into allowing the spell to be cast freely upon it, thereby avoiding the dragon's high Will save bonus).
As with the Dracorage mythal itself, this spell ignores a dragon's spell resistance.
Aggravate Dracorage functions only during the period of the Dracorage and has no effect on dragons at other times.
This spell counters or dispels abate Dracorage.

Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker's normal speed.
A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.
Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly.  The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds.  If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely.  If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.

Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch).
The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long.
In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates).
The spell has no effect on other creatures.
Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower.
Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates.
If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.
With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.

Reaching out, you pull them tight about your subject, creating an invisible cocoon of mystical forces.
This spell surrounds the subject with a mystical field that dampens the effects of magic.
While it is in effect, the enhancement bonus of any magic weapon used against the subject is lowered by 1.
For instance, a +4 longsword would have only a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when wielded against the subject.
However, even if a weapon's enhancement bonus is reduced below +1, its masterwork bonus still applies.
Similarly, every spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that affects the subject&#8212;whether it is specifically targeted on the subject or merely includes the subject in its area&#8212;takes a -1 penalty to caster level and save DC.
The subject of the spell can choose, as a move action, to lower this field to receive the full effects of beneficial spells, but doing so might leave him vulnerable until his next turn, since raising the effect again also requires a move action.
Ongoing magical effects already in place on the subject when dampen magic is cast (such as bull's strength or the enhancement bonuses of its own equipment) are unaffected, but any item the subject picks up and any spell he receives after dampen magic is in effect are affected as normal.
For every six caster levels above 7th that you possess, the spell reduces incoming effects by one additional point.
Thus, if your caster level is 13th-18th, the reduction to the enhancement bonus of weapons and the caster levels and save DCs of spells used against the subject is 2, and if your caster level is 19th or higher, the reduction is 3.
At any time when dampen magic has 5 or more rounds of duration left, the subject can render itself utterly immune to most magic for a brief period.
The effect produced is an antimagic field (PH200), which surrounds the subject to a radius of 5 feet.
Divide the remaining rounds of duration by 5 and round down; the result is the number of rounds the antimagic effect lasts.
Once that time expires, the spell ends, and once the antimagic field has been invoked, the original spell effect cannot be reinstated}}

The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.
For example, suppose the question is &quot;Will we do well if we venture into the ruined temple of Erythnul?&quot; The DM knows that a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a **+1 shield** lurks near the entrance but estimates that your party could beat the troll after a hard fight. Therefore the divination response might be: &quot;Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.&quot; In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. (For example, the troll could move away and take the treasure with it.)
The base chance for a correct **divination** is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.
As with <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/augury--2478/">**augury**</a>, multiple **divinations** about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first **divination** spell and yield the same answer each time.

For each spell you cast into the dweomer of transference, the psionic creature gets temporary power points, according to the following table.
The transference isn't perfectly efficient; for instance, if you cast a 7th-level spell at a psionic creature, it receives insufficient psionic power points to manifest a 7th-level power.

A fang trap functions like a glyph of warding, except that it can't be made to activate on the basis of faith or alignment, and you can't be caught in your own fang trap.
A fang trap is usually cast on a specific spot, such as a doorway or an area of floor.
It can be set to distinguish between humans and Scaled Ones, or between beings wearing particular items and those who are not.
The trigger can't be a symbol, but it may be one or more specific items (for example, &quot;six metal rings on digits, no more and no less&quot;).
When a fang trap discharges, the subject is held immobile for 1 round.
A successful Fortitude saving throw frees the subject after that period without further effect.
A failed save means the subject takes 1d4 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage per caster level from the bite of a pair of unseen jaws.
Material Component: A fang from any snake}}

An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw (unless its own is higher).
A creature wearing metal armor that fails its save is frozen in place.
The spell locks the armor's joints and seams in inches of solid ice.
The frozen creature takes the damage listed below.
In addition, it suffers a -6 penalty on attack rolls, a -8 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can't move.
A frozen character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + level of spell being cast) or lose the spell.
A creature wearing metal armor that makes its save takes half the damage listed below.
A creature not wearing metal armor that fails its save takes the damage listed below if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1, 2, 3, or 4 points; see the table) each round if it is not wearing metal armor or the metal that it is carrying weighs less than one-fifth of the creature's weight.
A creature not wearing or carrying metal less than one-fifth of its weight that makes its save is entirely unaffected by freeze armor.
Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage from a freeze armor spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the creature plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage}}

Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand.

Only a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 5 and a Wisdom score of at least 9 can receive this bestowal.
Only cleric spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration (healing) can be transferred.
The number and level of spells that the subject can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of imbue with spell ability can't exceed this limit.
The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and the like) function according to your level, not the level of the recipient.
Once you cast imbue with spell ability, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued spells or is slain, or until you dismiss the imbue with spell ability spell.
In the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put.
If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active imbue with spell ability spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.
To cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able to speak.
To cast a spell with a somatic component, it must have humanlike hands.
To cast a spell with a material component or focus, it must have the materials or focus}}

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).
You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.
The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from  donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be  made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.
A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. 
A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, the DM may halve or even waive the payment. For instance, a celestial creature called to battle demons might require a gift of only half the normal value.
At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).
Note:When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, a lesser planar ally is a fire spell when it calls a fire elemental}}

If the called creature would not fit in the place you occupied when you cast the spell, the spell fails. If the called creature is slain, you take 2d6 points of damage, the spell ends, and you are returned to your origin plane in the space last occupied by the called creature.
A celestial creature (MM 31) called by this spell gains damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5; spell resistance equal to its HD +5; and a smite evil attack that provides a bonus equal to its HD on one damage roll.
A fiendish creature (MM 107) called by this spell gains damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance equal to its HD +5; and a smite good attack that provides a bonus equal to its HD on one damage roll.
You have full control over the creature's actions and can perceive the environment around the called creature as if you were seeing through its eyes, hearing through its ears, and so on.
While in stasis, you can't take any actions other than to control the called creature or to dismiss the spell, nor can anything on the creature's home plane affect you in any way. You also can't perceive anything around your body's location. When you dismiss the spell, or when the creature is slain, you appear in the creature's location, and it is returned to its home plane.

It does not restore life to a dead body, but instead brings back a slain ghost as a ghost.
The spell requires some of the ghost's original ectoplasm (some of the ghost's ectoplasm that has been preserved with magic or alchemy is sufficient).
Alternatively, you may cast it on a dead creature's body to bring it back as a ghost.
The creature's soul is aware that it will return as a ghost instead of a living creature and can refuse to accept the spell if it does not want this to happen.
This form of the spell works only on creatures that can become ghosts.
As with other forms of this magic, if cast within the Manifest Ward, a raised ghost does not lose a level or a Constitution point when brought back from the dead}}

The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which spell resistance doesn't apply. Spell immunity protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. 
Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. Thus, a creature given immunity to lightning bolt is still vulnerable to shocking grasp or chain lightning.
A creature can have only one spell immunity or greater spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time}}

The wall can seal off a passage or breach, or be used to construct new walls.
A wall of salt is 1 inch thick per caster level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
You can form a wall of salt into nearly any shape desired.
The wall need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp.
If such a span is more than 20 feet long, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell's area by half.
For example, a 10th-level caster could create a salt span with a surface area of five 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth, by likewise reducing the area.
The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell or by chipping and breaking.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 3 hit points per inch and hardness 2.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 1 per inch of thickness.
Directing a constant blast of water at a wall of salt (for example, a geyser from a decanter of endless water) dissolves the mineral, dealing 10 points of damage per minute (which hardness does not reduce).
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of salt, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

This spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand. The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.
Creatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level).
Creatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located.
Any open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished.

Composed of a sheet of water rising vertically, the transparent wall does not prevent you from seeing beyond it. The water of the wall is calm as a lake on a windless day.**
This spell creates a 10-foot-thick wall of fresh water or seawater (as selected by you). The water forms around objects and creatures in its area, plunging these creatures and objects underwater. A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature's next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall.
Creatures can move through a wall of water by making Swim checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall.
Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location. Water brought out of the wall in a container instantly evaporates as the wall itself forms more water to replace what was removed.

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds.
If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you.
However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden.
Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf.
Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.
Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.
Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.
Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid.
If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession.
If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.
Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours.
The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process.
Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment.
No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment.
This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.
Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.
Note:Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (for NPCs).
This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively}}

Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone.
For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.
For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it.
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.

Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item&#8212;

However, dispel water cannot counter an instantaneous spell or effect.
You choose to use dispel water in one of three ways: to dry up a body of water, to counter a water-based spell or effect, or to dismiss an extraplanar creature of the water subtype.
Dry Up Water: This effect instantly destroys 200 cubic feet of water per level.
Remaining water rushes in to fill the void.
Cast in a large body of water, such as an ocean, the destruction of 1,000 or more cubic feet of water produces a strong current that pulls boats and creatures down.
Creatures caught in the current must make a DC 20 Swim check to avoid going under.
A creature that fails the Swim check is pulled down to a depth of 10 feet per caster level and must hold its breath or begin to drown (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
The current might capsize vessels: The chance is 95% for a craft shorter than 20 feet long, 50% for one from 20 to 60 feet long, and 20% for one over 60 feet long.
Counterspell:Used in this way, dispel water targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (see page 170 of the Player's Handbook).
It only counters spells and spell-like abilities that have the water descriptor, or appear on the Water domain spell list, or clearly involve water (such as create food and water, sleet storm, and wall of ice).
To successfully counter the other spell, you must make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level.
Dismiss Water Creature: Cast in this way, dispel water targets a single extraplanar creature of the water subtype within range.
The creature can negate the effect with a successful Will save (and its spell resistance, if any, applies).
If it fails to save or resist the spell, the creature is forced back to its home plane}}

In one stands a demon, and in the other stands your willing subject.
After an hour-long ritual incantation, you pull a roiling black cloud of demonic essence out of the demon and channel it into the willing recipient.
You transfer a portion of a demon's essence into a willing creature, enhancing one of its ability scores or skills.
The demon must be either allied and willing or captured and constrained (as if by a planar binding spell).
An unwilling demon can make a Will save to negate the effects of the spell.
Both the recipient and the donor demon must remain within specially prepared circles inscribed on the floor for the entire casting time.
These circles are similar to summoning circles and can be integrated into a summoning circle without impacting the function of either spell, but neither the demon nor the recipient need be summoned specifically into the circle for this spell's circle&#8212;each needs only to stand within it during the casting.
The benefit granted by this spell can be applied to one of the recipient's ability scores (as an enhancement bonus) or to one of his skills (as a competence bonus), as you designate.
Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed, and the effect cannot be dispelled except by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.
If you wish, you can increase the save DC for this spell by allowing the demon power over the target.
The specific concessions you can make to the demon and the corresponding increases to the save DC are given below.
+1 Increase: The donor demon can track the recipient's location and condition, effectively gaining the effect of a constant status spell on it.
+3 Increase: The demon can see through the recipient's eyes and hear through its ears.
+5 Increase: The demon can telepathically communicate with the recipient as if by Rary's telepathic bond.
+7 Increase: The demon can use demand on the recipient once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals your caster level at the time you cast extract gift).
The effects of the concessions are cumulative, but the save DC increases do not stack.
Thus, allowing the demon to track the recipient, use its senses, and communicate with it telepathically would increase the save DC by 5.
Increasing the save DC in this manner is an evil act, since it grants the demon more than the usual opportunity to work its evil.
Thus, using this option adds the evil descriptor to the spell.
Ability Bonus: The recipient gains an enhancement bonus to one ability score of your choice.
The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.
The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-fourth of your caster level (rounded down).
Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +2 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +5 bonus at 20th level.
You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.
The donor demon's ability modifier for the corresponding score must be at least twice that of the granted bonus.
Thus, to grant a +2 bonus to Dexterity, you must extract essence from a demon with a Dexterity score of at least 18 (such as a marilith).
To grant a +5 bonus to Charisma, you need a demon with a Charisma score of at least 30 (such as a lilitu).
Skill Bonus: The recipient gains a competence bonus on checks made with one skill of your choice.
The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.
The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-half your caster level (rounded down).
Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +4 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +10 bonus at 20th level.
You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.
The donor demon's ranks in the selected skill must be at least twice the granted bonus.
Thus, to grant a +5 bonus on Disable Device checks, you must extract essence from a demon with at least 10 ranks in Disable Device (such as a babau).
To grant a +10 bonus on Bluff checks, you need a demon with at least 20 ranks in Bluff (such as a balor).
Material Component: The circles in which the donor and recipient stand during the casting must be inscribed with expensive paints made from powdered diamonds, cold iron, blood, and various rare and exotic pigments.
Each circle must also be decorated with five flawless sapphires, which serve as conduits between the donor demon and the recipient.
The total cost of these pigments and gems depends on the nature and magnitude of the bonus to be imparted.
For an ability bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 1,000 gp (1,000 gp for +1, 4,000 gp for +2, 9,000 gp for +3, 16,000 gp for +4, and 25,000 gp for +5).
For a skill bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 100 gp (100 gp for +1, 400 gp for +2, 900 gp for +3, 1,600 gp for +4, 2,500 gp for +5, 3,600 gp for +6, 4,900 gp for +7, 6,400 gp for +8, 8,100 gp for +9, and 10,000 gp for +10).
XP Cost: You must spend XP equal to 1/25 the required cost of the material components when you cast this spell}}

The subject can answer in like manner immediately.
Creatures with Intelligence scores as low as 1 can understand the sending, though a subject's ability to react is limited normally by its Intelligence.

(Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably, at the option of the DM).

Once the spell is cast, your blood takes on a mystical potency that makes it more corrosive than the strongest acid to anyone who draws it from you.
From then on, until the spell's duration has elapsed, anyone who deals slashing or piercing melee damage on you is sprayed with your blood in retribution.
The blood deals a cumulative 1d6 points of damage per attack upon your attacker, with no save or spell resistance applicable, up to a maximum of 5d6.
Thus, the first time a foe hits you with a slashing or piercing weapon, he instantly takes 1d6 points of damage from the sanguinary backlash.
The second time that same foe strikes you, he takes 2d6 points of damage.
As soon as any single foe has taken 5d6 points of damage in a single spray from your corrosive blood, the spell ends.
Opponents striking you with magical attacks that do not manifest in a slashing or piercing manner, or those striking you with only bludgeoning weapons, do not trigger the retributive blood spray.
The arc and direction of the blood spray is magical in nature, and the spray does not splatter adjacent squares or parties, no matter how close together they might be.
Each spray strikes only the one responsible for the wound.
Material Component: A drop of your own blood}}

Flaywind burst can't move a creature beyond its range.

Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.
(This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell).
Third, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature.

The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect.
You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment.
For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of your alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposed alignment or an enemy faith.
At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting hallow again.
Spell effects that may be tied to a hallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth.

In addition, any living creature struck by the incarnum weapon takes 1 point of Wisdom drain (a successful Will save negates the Wisdom drain).
The weapon takes a form based on your alignment: battleaxe (chaotic), flail (evil), warhammer (good), or longsword (law).
Casters can choose any weapon whose alignment is not opposed to theirs (neutral casters can choose any of the four weapons).
Regardless of the weapon's form, it threatens a critical only on a 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit.
The incarnum weapon strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn.
It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus.
It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon; for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction.
The weapon always strikes from your direction.
It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.
Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon.
If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers.
Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target.
If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target.
On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack.
Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to.
An incarnum weapon cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but it can be affected by any effect that would affect a spell or a soulmeld.
An incarnum weapon's Armor Class against touch attacks is 11 (10 + size bonus for Small object).
Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in the incarnum weapon adds a +1 insight bonus on the weapon's attack rolls and damage rolls and expands the weapon's critical threat range by 1.
For example, an incarnum weapon spell with 2 points of essentia invested would have a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and would have a critical threat range of 18-20}}

Thus, they begin their initial interactions with the subject one step nearer to a hostile attitude than they normally would, unless they already know the subject personally.
Furthermore, the subject takes a -10 circumstance penalty on all Diplomacy checks designed to change the attitudes of others.
(See Diplomacy, PH 71).
In addition, the subject takes a -4 penalty to a specific ability score based on your deity, as given in the table for the divine retribution spell (page 119).
This penalty cannot be removed in any way as long as the mark of sin remains, if you do not worship a deity, you must choose one whose alignment is within one step of your own when you cast this spell for the first time.
This choice is for the purpose of this effect only, and you cannot subsequently change it unless your ] alignment shifts in such a way that your previous choice is no longer applicable.
A mark of sin cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish,miracle, remove curse,
or wish spell.
Remove curse works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than that of the mark of sin}}

On the Plane of Mirrors, you will find other windows that represent similar mirrors tied together by some strong bond.
Frequently they were all made by the same artisan, but mirrors with particularly strong-willed owners or mirrors made at a particular historic moment may also be tied together.
When on the Plane of Mirrors, you can see through these other mirrors without being seen, allowing you to spy on others.
You can reach through the mirror to grab items that are within easy reach, or even grapple with someone within arm's reach of the mirror.
A grappled individual will be drawn onto the Plane of Mirrors and becomes a new subject of the mirror walk spell.
For each subject, the mirror walk spell ends when a second mirror is passed through.
Other mirrorwalkers aren't affected.
Using the mirror walk spell is not without danger.

A streamer moves on its own, pursuing its target without your concentration, hovering in the same space as the target with a readied touch attack.
Whenever the target next takes any sort of action, the streamer makes a touch attack against it (at the caster's base attack bonus).
On a successful attack roll, the streamer deals 5d10 points of damage.

Streamers can be attacked (AC 20), but only magic weapons have any effect on them.

For example, a barbed devil subject to subvert planar essence would have no damage reduction and spell resistance 13, while a pit fiend would have damage reduction 5/good and silver, and spell resistance 22.
An outsider attempts a Fortitude save and checks spell resistance when it first enter the spell's area. If it makes the save or the spell fails to overcome its spell resistance, that creature is thereafter unaffected by this casting of subvert planar essence and can enter and exit the spell area without making further saves. Outsiders that fail their saves and have their spell resistance overcome by the spell are affected as long as they remain within the spell's area, and they are automatically affected if they leave and reenter the area.

Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.
True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does  not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.

Any time during the spell's duration, the target can release the power of the aura by making a melee touch attack against an undead creature. On a successful attack, the aura pulses angrily as it tears apart the negative energy sustaining the creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and dazing it for 1 round. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the daze effect. Since the spell utilizes positive energy to deal damage, incorporeal creatures do not benefit from the normal miss chance for incorporeality. Using the touch attack ends the spell's duration.
A deathless creature (see page 275 of the <span class="caps">EBERRON</span> Campaign Setting) targeted by the touch attack power of this spell is instead healed of 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.
(This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell).
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site.
The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect.
You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment.
For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of like alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposite alignment or an enemy faith.
At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement,
invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth.

It merges into adjoining rock surfaces, melting the rock at the point of connection to form a smooth bond.
The wall can seal off a passage or breach, but the intense heat causes flammable materials in contact with the wall of magma to catch fire instantly.
A wall of magma is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
You can shape a wall of magma into sheets and curves, but the molten wall cannot form domes or unsupported horizontal surfaces more than 5 feet across.
The wall need not be vertical but must rest upon a firm foundation; it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
The wall cannot hold complex forms such as crenellations.
It is possible (though difficult) to form the wall into a ring to enclose creatures, but they can avoid this with successful Reflex saves.
The wall sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet.
Unlike a wall of fire, both sides of a wall of magma radiate heat.
Since it is molten, the wall cannot be broken as such, but an object or creature could force its way through.
It costs 4 squares of movement to move through a square containing a wall of magma, but creatures of the earth subtype can pass through the wall at normal speed.
A wall of magma deals 5d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to creatures passing through it, the same amount each round to any creature within it, and 2d6 points of fire damage per round for 1d3 rounds after a creature leaves the area of the wall.
It deals double damage to undead and creatures with the water subtype.
The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell.
If any 5-foot section of the wall takes 40 points of cold damage or more in a round, that section hardens into normal stone (hardness 8, 15 hit points per inch of thickness), which can then be chipped or broken as normal (DC 20 Strength check, +2 per inch of thickness).
Do not divide cold damage by four, as normal for objects.
Casting create water on the surface of a wall of magma creates a cloud of steamy fog that fills a cube with the dimensions of the length of wall affected.
The fog dissipates after 10 minutes.
Only the surface of the stone hardens; the wall is not cooled completely.
Wall of magma can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent wall of magma that is chilled by cold damage stays solid for 10 minutes, then returns to its molten state}}

This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
It must always be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.
A wall of ooze is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
The caster can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 50 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 0.
A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 +2 per inch of thickness.
Any creature touching the wall takes 2d6 points of acid damage per round from the corrosive, burning nature of the ooze.
Only the surrounding material that the wall initially is conjured to touch&#8212;such as the floor or an adjoining wall&#8212;is immune to this damage.
Furthermore, a creature that touches the wall must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed by the ooze.
The wall then consumes the creature in 1d6 rounds, digesting it and adding the creature's full normal hit point total to its own.

It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.
A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell's area by half.
Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round.

A quori spirit possessing an Inspired host can add the levels of the host body to its Hit Dice for the purpose of resisting this spell. If the spirit succeeds on the save, it can abandon the host body as a free action. If it chooses not to abandon the host, the possessing spirit remains bound.
Any attack that deals hit point damage or ability damage to the host creature deals the same damage to the possessing spirit. The possessing spirit cannot be killed in this way, but if it or the host creature is taken to 0 or fewer hit points, the possessing spirit is forced from the body as if subject to a dismissal spell. Also, its psychic wounds prevent it from possessing any other host for a number of days (as reckoned on the Material Plane) equal to the amount of hit point damage and ability damage dealt to it.
**Material Component:** A sphere of volcanic glass, which is shattered as the spell is cast.}}

A spellcaster on the ice must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.
The ice rift affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an ice rift spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
Ice or Snow Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and burying that creature in snow.
An ice rift cast on the roof of a very large ice or snow cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Edge of a Glacier: Ice rift causes a glacier's edge to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An ice rift cast at the top of a 100-foot glacier would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the glacier.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath rubble (see below).
Open Glacier: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.
Fissures open in the ice, and every creature on the ice has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
Frozen Water: Fissures open in the ice, and every creature on the ice has a 25% chance to fall into the freezing water (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
Characters who fall into a fissure are immediately subject to hypothermia and take 2d6 points of cold damage from the frigid water.

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.

This spell creates an airtight stone coffin that forms around the target. The stone is 1 inch thick, has hardness 8, and requires 15 points of damage to break through. Decreasing its size does not change the thickness of the walls; the coffin is always just large enough to hold the subject. This coffin is sealed upon formation and completely impervious to air and gas. A creature trapped within a  sarcophagus of stone has 1 hour worth of air, and after that time must hold its breath or begin to suffocate (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 304). A creature that has no need to breathe (such as a construct, elemental, or undead) needs not fear suffocation, but it remains trapped within the sarcophagus until it breaks free or is freed.
A creature within the coffin can attack the stone with a natural weapon or light melee weapon. A creature can attempt a DC 26 Strength check to break free of the stone, and allies can also help to break the trapped creature free.
Material Component: A fragment of a sarcophagus}}

As though leaping down from an invisible charger, a translucent knight, clad head to toe in heavy plate, appears by your side.
The holy symbol of your deity is emblazoned across his tabard and shield.
By casting this spell, you create a translucent knight made of force.
It remains within 5 feet of you at all times, constantly matching your speed and mode of travel&#8212;even if you are mounted or magically accelerated.
Any time you are attacked, it moves to parry the attack with its shield or longsword, granting you a +6 deflection bonus to Armor Class.
As a standard action in any round, you can command the knight to make a single attack against any creature within 5 feet.
It strikes with its longsword, using your base attack bonus and applying your Wisdom modifier to the roll.
The attack deals 1d8 points of force damage +1 extra point per three caster levels (maximum +10).
At any point before the spell expires, you can turn the knight loose and order it to fight on its own.
It then moves at a speed of 60 feet to attack any foe you designate.
It continues to use your base attack bonus and your Wisdom modifier for its attack rolls, and it can make as many attacks per round as your base attack bonus allows.
You need not concentrate on the knight as long as it is fighting a specific opponent, but commanding it to change foes requires a move action.
If its opponent falls, the knight waits for your direction.
Once you have turned the knight loose, you lose the deflection bonus to Armor Class that it provided, and you cannot regain it.
Furthermore, the remaining duration of the spell converts from minutes per level to rounds per level on a one-to-one basis}}

If the target's alignment differs from yours but contains no directly opposing components (for example, the target is neutral good and you are lawful neutral), the spell deals 1
point of damage per caster level (maximum 15) and has no secondary effect.
If the target's alignment has one aspect opposed to yours (such as law/chaos), but not both, the spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4), and the subject suffers a minor secondary effect (see the table above).
If the target's alignment is diametrically opposed to yours (such as lawful good/chaotic evil), the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), and the subject suffers a moderate secondary effect (see the table below).
If you cast this spell on the same target in 2 consecutive rounds, any secondary effect the spell has increases by one &quot;step&quot; in severity.

Minor and moderate effects end in 1 round per caster level, but major effects are permanent until dispelled.

Any creature passing through the curtain takes 12d4 points of damage, with a Reflex save for half damage.
If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the curtain.
Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice, where feasible) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save.
A successful Reflex save means the creature has reached either side of the wall without taking any damage.
A creature inside a whirl of fangs takes 2d4 points of damage (Reflex save for half) on its turn each round that it remains in contact with the effect.
You can move through or remain within your own whirl of fangs without taking damage.

You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability.
If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability.
Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent.
If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form.
Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form).
As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes.
This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end}}

You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.
A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.
All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

An unwilling creature can't be teleported by word of recall.

Once the spell is active, the subject must attack foes of opposite alignment every round if able to do so, or the spell effect ends.

If you create a zealot pact with a neutral deity (such as Obad-Hai), choose one alignment from among the following that triggers the zealot pact: lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic evil, or -chaotic good.
A creature can be subject to only one zealot pact at a time. Casting zealot pact on a subject that already has an untriggered zealot pact voids the earlier pact}}

*A creature's surface thoughts.*Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire.*One nugget of information per caster level from all the minds regarding one particular topic, thing, or being.*The thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail.
Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature's mind, you can attempt (as a standard action) to implant a **suggestion** (PH 285) in the mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make another Will saving throw to resist the **suggestion**, using the original save DC. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by the **suggestion.**) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the brain spider for that creature}}

The spell deals 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points). At the same time, you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt, up to a maximum equal to the current hit points of the target. For example, a 13th-level cleric would normally deal 65 points of damage to an undead creature. However, if that creature had only 48 hit points remaining, the caster would gain only 48 hit points (even as the target was destroyed). These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. A successful Will save halves the damage dealt and the hit points gained.

Then the light of a malevolent evil flares in the host's eyes as it rushes to attack, and you know you have only one chance.**
When this spell is cast on a possessed creature, the posÂ­sessing spirit is temporarily bound within its host and inextricably locked to that host's life force. If the lifebound creature is slain, both the host and the possessing spirit die.
While under the effect of this spell, the host creature automatically falls under the complete control of the posÂ­sessing spirit (<span class="caps">ECS</span> 101). For the purpose of combat, the lifebound creature uses its own attacks and special abilities (with any enhancements provided by the possession), but can make use of any of the possessing spirit's spell-like, psi-like, or supernatural abilities, even if the possessÂ­ing spirit normally does not have use of those abilities while possessing the host creature. The lifebound creature makes use of the possessing spirit's abilities in ways that make sense for its own form. For example, an Inspired that has a tsucora quori spirit would gain that creature's terrifying sting supernatural ability, but would use the
ability through its natural attacks or weapon attacks (the Inspired's choice).
The possessing spirit takes no damage from attacks directed at the host creature. However, if a lifebound host is slain (taken to -10 hit points), the possessing spirit is instantly destroyed. The host creature can then be raised or resurrected if such magic is available.
Many outsiders are tied to the energy of their plane, and so are never permanently destroyed. For example, this spell could destroy the personality and memories of a particular quori spirit, but that spirit's energy returns to Dal Quor to eventually form a new quori of the same kind. However, a spirit destroyed by this spell cannot reÂ­form for a number of weeks (as reckoned on the Material Plane) equal to its Hit Dice.
The magic needed to bind a possessing spirit to a host body is both powerful and unstable. As a result, neither the caster of this spell nor the possessing spirit or host creature knows the spell's duration, which is rolled in secret by the DM. Each round as a full-round action, the lifebound creature can make a special Will save (DC equal to spell's save DC minus possessing spirit's HD + your caster level). A quori spirit possessing an Inspired host can add the levels of the host body to its Hit Dice for the purpose of resisting this spell. If the spirit succeeds on the save, it can abandon the host body as a free action. If it chooses not to abandon the host, the possessing spirit remains bound}}

When you cast pact of return, you must state either a specific creature or a set of specific circumstances that you expect will be responsible for your death at some point within the spell's duration.
If you name a creature, that creature does not have to deal the deathblow to trigger the release of the spell, but it must play an active part in your demise.
If you name a set of circumstances, those circumstances must be reasonably specific or the spell will fail, leaving you well and truly dead.
An acceptable set of circumstances would be, &quot;I expect energy draining to play a pivotal role in my demise&quot;, whereas an unacceptable set would be, &quot;I expect to die from loss of hit points&quot;.
The DM decides whether the terms are acceptable.
Whether the subject of your demise is a specific person or a specific source, you must die (that is, reach -10 hit points or lower) for the spell to take effect.
If you do, and the circumstances of your demise are similar enough to those described when you cast the spell (DM's discretion), you are instantly resurrected (see page 272 of the Player's Handbook) with no level loss.
You can have more than one pact of return active at the same time, each one to be triggered by a different foe or set of circumstances, but you must keep track of the total time that has elapsed for each.
A pact of return that has not yet taken effect is still a magical effect (and a powerful necromantic one, at that), which can be dispelled by one who detects its presence}}

The mists within the reflective surface dissipate, and suddenly you can see and hear a familiar place.
You can see and hear what occurs at a location, which can be at any distance on the same plane where you are located.
You must make a successful caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) to scry a specific location.
The difficulty of this check depends on how familiar you are with that location and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that place.
Furthermore, the difficulty to scry the desired locale increases if the location is extremely far removed, indoors or underground, or on another plane.
The DC of this check is 20 + any modifiers related to your knowledge of the area, your connection to it, and the location's distance, as set out in the following table.
If you fail this check, the scrying attempt simply fails.
If the caster level check succeeds, you create an invisible magical sensor in any location you desire.
Through this sensor you can both see and hear, your vantage and range of vision being the same as if you were actually at that place, allowing you to make Spot and Listen checks as normal.
You can rotate the sensor as you wish, seeing in any direction you desire.
Once the spell is cast, however, you cannot change the position of the sensor.
As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects.
In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message.
If the caster level check fails, you can't attempt to scry on any place within 1 mile of that location until 24 hours have passed}}

The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices (such as a robe of eyes or a gem of seeing).

The stone remains there until triggered, either by special conditions set by you or by a command word you choose.
Once triggered, the stone trap turns visible and falls naturally.
The stone of the stone trap can be positioned so that it holds up additional material within the weight limit of the spell.
For example, a 2,200-pound stone with stone trap cast on it by a 13th-level cleric could support an additional 400 pounds.
This additional weight could be placed on top of the stone in midair, the stone could function as a plug in a hole in a ceiling, and so on.
As a trap, the suspended stone has an attack bonus equal to your caster level.
Any creatures hit by the stone when it falls take 1d6 points of damage for every 200 pounds of weight, plus 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet the stone falls, for a maximum of 20d6 points of damage.
Anything atop the stone might deal additional damage, but such supplementary material can only deal damage above and beyond the maximum (20d6) if it doesn't rely on the fall to deal that damage.
The conditions for triggering a stone trap can be as simple or as elaborate as you desire.
Special conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Other intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.
For example, a stone trap can be set to activate when a lawful evil creature approaches, but not when a blackguard approaches.

Distant chords of a harsh and terrible symphony&#8212;as if multiple orchestras played different pieces simultaneously&#8212;echo continuously in the air as you reach for your victim.**
A creature targeted by this spell loses the ability to dream during sleep or rest. Rather, in place of dreams, the subject's slumbering mind is filled with the sounds of a discordant orchestra. After the victim's first attempt to sleep, it incurs a -2 penalty on Wisdom-based skill checks. This penalty persists as long as the symphonic nightmare maintains its hold. This spell affects all creatures that sleep or enter sleep-like trances, although creatures without the need to sleep are effectively immune.
In addition, the creature's sleep is now haunted. It can no longer gain complete rest from sleeping or resting. The subject does not regain hit points or heal ability damage naturally, nor is it able to prepare spells if doing so requires a full night's rest.
The creature is, however, now immune to the dream and nightmare spells, as well as to other effects that cause nightmares (such as the night hag's dream haunting ability).
You can lift the effect of this curse at will, but it is otherwise difficult to remove a symphonic nightmare before its duration expires. A remove curse cast at a higher caster level than the symphonic nightmare spell removes it, as does a successful break enchantment. Otherwise, a wish or miracle is required to lift the curse.
This spell can also be cast on a creature you are scrying, or on a creature distant from you if you hold something the creature carried within the past 24 hours}}

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.
An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. 
Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result). 
A normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field.
Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more about artifacts).
Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field}}

Smite Chaos (Su): Once per day, the target can make a normal attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD total (maximum +20) against a chaotic opponent.

The caster infects the first victim by making a successful melee touch attack.
A subject who fails a Will save is afflicted with insanity (a continuous confusion effect).
This condition is permanent until countered, and the madness can be passed to anyone the victim touches.
Anyone who makes the initial saving throw is immune to that casting of the chain of chaos spell.
Each person the subject touches during the spell's duration (including by successful melee attack) must make a Will save at the spell's DC or suffer the insanity effect.
Each additional victim in turn can pass the madness on for a period of one day per five caster levels after being infected.
The spell affects a maximum of five persons per caster level.
Individual victims can be restored by any means effective against insanity, for example, greater restoration, limited wish,
miracle, or wish.
Anyone restored cannot be affected again by that casting of the chain of chaos spell.
DM Note: When dealing with the effect of this spell on a large nonadventuring population over a period of time, it is not necessary to track each individual affected by this spell.

The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more.
The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack.
A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.
The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below).
An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.
Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.
Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on hit points for walls and the like).
Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground.
Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.
Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand.
At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
Pinned beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.
If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead}}

The effect lasts for 1 round, although the water created by the spell does not disappear after 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground within the area cannot move or attack.
A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to successfully cast a spell.
The force of the water and debris deals those caught in the area 1d6 points of nonlethal damage plus another 1d6 points per five caster levels (maximum 4d6).
Any creature or object that is not soundly secured is pushed violently to the outer edge of the area.
If this forces the creature or object into a solid surface, it takes 8d6 points of damage.
A creature holding onto a sturdy object can make a DC 20 Strength check to avoid being moved.
A creature not already holding onto such an object can make a DC 20 Reflex save or Swim check to grab one.
A creature of Huge size or larger can make a DC 30 Strength check to dig in its feet and simply withstand the oncoming wave.
A creature that fails any of these checks falls prone in addition to being swept away.
The specific effect and aftereffects of a flashflood spell on the environment depend on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
When the spell is completed, a total volume of 100,000 cubic feet of water (400 5-foot squares, in a 120-ft. cone, 10 feet deep) is left behind.
This water behaves like ordinary water&#8212;draining away and leaving puddles in most cases, or perhaps forming a shallow lake or pond.
Unless the caster has taken care to create the flashflood in a cleared area, however, the water left behind is full of debris, dirt, and perhaps a few corpses.
Such water is unfit to drink.
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The sudden surge of water knocks down support beams, but otherwise has no real effect, aside from filling the tunnel with water to a depth of 10 feet.
If the area is insufficient to support 100,000 cubic feet of water, the water level rises above 10 feet until the entire volume is filled, or it spills outward from the confines of the original 400 squares.
What happens is based on the layout of the area.
In the case of level terrain, the water simply drains away over the course of a minute or so, leaving pools in depressions from which it cannot drain.
When the ground in a tunnel is not level, the water might flood sections of the tunnel.
In such cases, determine whether the flooded area is sufficient to contain the entire volume of water created&#8212;
and, if not, how deeply the water floods the next level up.
Any creatures caught in water over their heads might drown.
For example, Miyish casts flashflood in the dungeon of a ruined castle.
The dungeon's total volume is only 40,000 cubic feet (160 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling).
The remaining 60,000 cubic feet of water has to go somewhere, so it rushes up and out the entrance to the dungeon.
Since the terrain above the dungeon is another level of the castle, and is basically watertight, the water collects up here.
The total volume of this level is 80,000 cubic feet (320 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling), leaving 20,000 cubic feet of air.
Since the water has nowhere to go but up, and it has gone as high as it can, the water on this level is 7-1/2 feet deep (60,000 cubic feet divided by 8,000&#8212;the square footage of 320 5-foot squares).
If Miyish can't swim or breathe water, he has made a grave tactical error by casting flashflood in an area too small to contain it.
Cliffs: Casting flashflood at the base of a cliff has no effect on the cliff.
Casting flashflood from the top of a cliff can force creatures and objects over the edge, so that they take falling damage.
Open Ground: Creatures on open ground are safest from the worst effects of flashflood.
They might be knocked prone by the force of the water, or even swept 120 feet (24 squares) away, but they are not in any particular danger of drowning or being crushed.
Structure(s): Any structure standing on open ground takes 60 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden building, but not a structure built of stone, masonry, or reinforced masonry.
Hardness reduces this damage, but it isn't halved as damage dealt to objects normally is.
Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half).
The debris is swept away by the flashflood.
River, Lake, or Marsh: The river, lake, or marsh overflows its banks, though with rivers the effect is transitory.
In the case of lakes and marshes, determine how much the body of water overflows, given the 100,000 cubic feet of water added to it.
Only calculate this amount if the total surface area of the lake or marsh is less than 40,000 square feet&#8212;and even then, it's only academic unless it is important to determine whether something on the shore gets wet}}

The construct's body becomes covered in a thin skin of clay, flesh, iron, or stone (depending on the type of golem immunity chosen), and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the construct, depending on the type of golem immunity conferred by the spell.
<strong>Clay:</strong> A move earth spell drives the construct back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it. A disintegrate spell slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage. An earthquake spell cast directly at the construct stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage. The construct gets no saving throw against any of these effects.
Any magical attack against the construct that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage.
<strong>Flesh:</strong> A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.
<strong>Iron:</strong> A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against fire effects. The construct is affected as an iron construct by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell, regardless of its original composition.
<strong>Stone:</strong> A transmute rock to mud spell slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock acts as a <a href="/spells/eberron-campaign-setting--12/total-repair--4814/">**total repair**</a> spell.

Two new symbols are described below; the others appear in the symbol spell description in the Player's Handbook.
Death Symbol of Bane: This type of symbol was created by the worshipers of Bane and lost until that dark deity was reborn in 1372 DR.
A death symbol of Bane is always carefully engraved and never quickly scribed.
It is triggered as you designate, within the guidelines of the symbol spell.
However, a person wearing a holy symbol of Bane never triggers the spell.
A death symbol of Bane functions exactly like a symbol of death,
except that any creatures within 60 feet of the death symbol of Bane that survive must make two more Fortitude saves, the first to avoid taking 1d12 points of cold damage and the second to avoid the effects of a doom spell.
This version of the symbol spell has the death and evil descriptors.
Material Component: A paste made from the symbol spell's material components and the blood of intelligent sacrificed creatures (minimum 3 Intelligence) whose Hit Dice total at least 30 that have been killed within the past year.
Once a creature's blood is used for this spell, that same creature's blood cannot be used in the material component for another death symbol of Bane.
Symbol of Spell Loss: This is another variant of the symbol spell.
When triggered, the symbol of spell loss begins to attack the minds of spellcasters within 60 feet.
Each caster must attempt a Will saving throw every round he or she is in this area.
Failure means that the highest-level spell prepared by the spellcaster (or highest-level spell slot, if the character casts spells like a sorcerer or bard) is lost.
The symbol remains until it has erased 30 levels of spells.
The symbol attacks creatures with spell-like abilities as if they had spells.
It has no effect on creatures without spells or spell-like abilities.
This version of the symbol spell is a mind-affecting spell}}

When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150.
The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.
Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first.
Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.
A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.
Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).
To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.
Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.
As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.
Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).
Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.
In this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.
Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.
You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.
Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.
These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.
Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.
For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.
Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.
If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.
Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.
Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.
Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.
Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.
You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.
Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.
An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.
Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.
Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death}}

The true banishment spell affects only a single creature, but there's no Hit Dice limit other than the one implicit in the Truespeak check DC.
Objects that the target hates, fears, or opposes don't grant bonuses on the level check to overcome the creature's spell resistance.

The demons obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the demons. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time}}

The spell has no effect on spellcasters of a faith other than your own.
You can pronounce an anathema upon any character of your faith, no matter where he is, even if on a different plane.
You cannot pronounce an anathema against someone who is already dead.
Some deities do not allow an anathema to be pronounced against the innocent or against their chosen, while others grant their high-level clerics free use of this most terrible of divine curses.
An individual under anathema can no longer cast divine spells or call upon the power of his god to turn or command undead, heal, harm, smite, shape change, or use any other divine power associated with his character class.
An ordinary worshiper placed under anathema is not allowed to take advantage of any of the faith's services, such as healing, naming, marrying, or burial of the dead.
Anyone who dies while under anathema is barred from entry into his deity's plane just as though he had never declared allegiance to a god.
His soul is condemned to eternally writhe in the Wall of
the Faithless.
On a more personal level, the anathema spell marks the subject as accursed with regard to others of the faith.
They are not allowed to speak to him, look at him, or even acknowledge his existence.
The common members of the faith are only aware that the subject is under anathema if so informed by the church hierarchy; however, clerics, paladins, druids and rangers of the faith can automatically detect an anathema effect simply by looking at the subject.
The effect is permanent until lifted, either by the original spellcaster, or by a cleric of the same faith, of a higher level than the caster, who casts an atonement spell upon the subject.
The subject of an anathema can also remove its effect by changing his divine allegiance (see Changing Deities, page 233 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting).
Focus: The subject's name must be inscribed in a book or scroll especially consecrated for this purpose and detailing the crimes (real or imagined) for which the subject is being condemned.
The book is not consumed in the process}}

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.
These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times.
If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation.
The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.
Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will.
To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord.
If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically.
Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).
When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely.
Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them.
The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you)}}

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the **gate**. The **gate** itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
A **gate** has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the **gate** from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
**Planar Travel:** As a mode of planar travel, a **gate** spell functions much like a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/plane-shift--2423/">**plane shift**</a> spell, except that the **gate** opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a **gate** from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you&#8212;anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A **gate** cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
You could position a **gate** in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.
You may hold the **gate** open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.
**Calling Creatures:** The second effect of the **gate** spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the **gate** to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the **gate**, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a **gate** that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).
If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual&#8212;for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin&#8212;you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.
A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.
If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in &quot;livestock&quot; rather than in coin, which could involve complications). Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward.

A creature affected by investiture of the hellfire engine gains all the benefits described under the iron body spell (PH 245), except that its flesh transforms into living cold iron.
Its unarmed natural attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
In addition, the subject can breathe a 30-foot cone of hellfire that deals 8d10 points damage.
This damage is not fire damage, and is not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy (fire), fire shield (chill shield),
and similar magic.
All creatures in the area are entitled to a Reflex save against the spell's DC for half damage.
The subject must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of this breath weapon.
The subject also gains resistance to fire 20.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the chain devil).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.

You infuse a creature with the terrifying power of a pit fiend.
The spell causes the subject's mouth to expand to accommodate new dripping fangs.
To add to this devilish effect, a pair of red leathery wings tears free from the flesh of the subject's back, granting it a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability.
The subject of the spell gains these benefits regardless of his aspect choice (see below).
The power granted to the subject by investiture of the pit fiend can manifest in one of three ways.
At the beginning of each round, the invested creature chooses which aspect of the spell will be in place.
Aspect of Tyranny: The invested creature's hands lengthen to horrific claws, and the creature gains powerful melee attacks.
While the aspect of tyranny is in effect, the invested creature can attack with both its claws and wings.
Each attack deals base damage of 2d6 points.
The claws are treated as primary melee attacks with a natural weapon, and the wing attacks are treated as secondary attacks with a natural weapon.
When making attacks with these claws and wings, the invested creature has a base attack bonus equal to its character level (or Hit Dice, if the invested creature has a level adjustment).
When taking a full attack action and using only the natural weapons granted by the aspect of tyranny, the secondary attacks are made with only a -2 penalty rather than the normal -5.
Because these are natural attacks, the invested creature cannot make multiple attacks because of a high base attack bonus.
Aspect of Pestilence:When the invested creature chooses to manifest the aspect of pestilence, it can, as a standard action, release a cloud of disease-ridden air.
Creatures within 10 feet of the subject when it generates this effect must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw against the spell's DC or take 2 points of Strength damage.
Aspect of Terror:When the invested creature chooses to manifest the aspect of terror, it can, as a standard action, release a powerful wave of fear.
Creatures within 10 feet of the subject when it generates this effect must succeed on a Will saving throw against the spell's DC or become frightened for 2 rounds.
This wave of fear is a mind-affecting fear effect.
The subject gains immunity to poison and resistance to fire 20.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the pit fiend).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute}}

Mystra's symbol appears drawn in silver on each palm (or on the chest and forehead of beings lacking palms) as a glowing brand equal that sheds light as a candle.
A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or wizard, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw.
Any time the target casts a spell, he gains a number of negative levels equal to the level of the spell being cast.
(The spell he just cast functions normally at the caster level he possessed before he received the negative levels for casting that spell).
This effect is cumulative and lasts as long as the crowning touch lasts.
There is no saving throw to avoid gaining the negative levels, but 24 hours after gaining each negative level, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = crowning touch's spell save) for each negative level.
If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed.
With each spell use, streaks of silver appear in the hair of the target, until the transgressor's hair is all silver (which happens when the character's level reaches 1st).
The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a wish spell or a successful break enchantment spell (caster level check DC 15 + caster level of the crowning touch).
After the curse is lifted, all the effects (except permanent level loss) go away.
This spell was developed for use only against beings who misuse the sort of magic Mystra has dominion over.
The Lady of Mysteries does not look kindly on mages who hurl deadly magic at every spellcaster who insults them.
Mystra has been known to shorten the effects on the truly repentant and the undeserving, if they pray to her for forgiveness and obtain an atonement spell}}

If the miracle has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost. 
Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle costs the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.<ul><li>Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</li><li>Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.</li><li>Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</li></ul>
In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a miracle duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.}}

Floating in space, you begin to construct reality anew with your words and gestures.
You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane.
Demiplanes created by this spell are very small, very minor planes.
This spell works best when cast while you are on the Astral Plane (various spells allow access to these planes, including plane shift and gate).
Casting this spell creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane.
At first, the fledgling plane has a 100-foot radius.
Once created, it grows by 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per year).
Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using plane shift or some other spell or permanent link that you arrange for separately.
You determine the environment within the demiplane when you cast word of genesis, reflecting most any desire you can visualize.
You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain.
This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create objects or constructed elements (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth).
You must add these details in some other fashion if you desire.
You can't create lingering magical effects with this power; you have to add those separately, if desired.
Similarly, you can't create a demiplane out of esoteric material such as silver or uranium; you're limited to stone and dirt.
You can't manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as the Material Plane.
Once your demiplane is complete, you can cast the spell again and again, each time increasing its radius by another 100 feet.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the truename of the place you're creating; the Truespeak DC is 50}}
