Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker's normal speed.
A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.
Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly.  The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds.  If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely.  If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.
You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air.  You can train a mount to move with the aid of air walk (counts as a trick; see page 74) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.}}

The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2-2 in the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>.  The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change.
The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.
<strong>Special: When casting <em>animal growth</em> as a Scalykind Domain spell, only ophidian and reptilian creatures are affected.</strong>
If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.  If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it&#8212;the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.
The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting.}}

The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.
Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you.  It advances and awaits your bidding.  You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain).  The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own.  You can attach some small item or note to the messenger.  The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.  Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored.  The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example).

<strong>Bear:</strong> You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution. In addition, if you have a natural claw attack, you gain the improved grab special attack. This ability allows you to make a free grapple attempt against a foe at least one size category smaller than you whenever you hit with your natural claw attack. For more information, see page 310 of the Monster Manual.
<strong>Tiger:</strong> You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. In addition, you gain the pounce special attack, allowing you to follow a charge with a full attack (including rake attacks). For more information, see page 313 of the Monster Manual.

If this trip attempt fails, your opponent cannot react to trip you.
Razorclaw shifters tend to prefer the bear or tiger aspects of this spell, while longtooth shifters prefer the wolf aspect.

You create an aura of blue mist that protects you against fire, absorbing the first 10 points of fire damage as a resist energy (fire) spell (PH 272). In addition to the resist energy (fire) effect, the spell can be used to snuff out fires.
Any nonmagical flame that the aura contacts is immediately extinguished if the flame's maximum damage is 10 or fewer points per round. This means that torches, small fires, and hurled alchemist's fire are snuffed out and cause no damage if used against you or if you touch them.
You can use a standard action to touch an existing magical fire (such as a flaming sphere or a wall of fire) and attempt to dispel it as if using a dispel magic spell against it (use the caster level of aura against flame for the caster level check). If you succeed, you take no damage from the touch and the magical fire and aura both vanish. If you fail, you take damage from the magical fire source normally (reduced by your aura against flame), and both spells remain.
With a readied action, you can use the aura as a dispel magic effect to counterspell a magical fire attack against you. If successful, the spell is counterspelled and the aura disappears. If you fail the dispel check, or if the attack is not a fire attack, the aura remains.}}

In a moment you're safe, and you gain a brief respite&#8212;time enough to cast more permanent protective spells.</em>
You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 150).
Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows a character to breathe water on a water-dominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by avoid planar effects can't be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character's full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don't deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects.
In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects. In the D&amp;D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane.
The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades).
The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won't protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane.}}

A creature that strikes a slime-protected subject with an unarmed strike, a touch attack (including a touch spell), or a natural weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage. Any creature in a grapple with the target of babau slime takes 1d8 points of acid damage at the beginning of its turn.

If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.
If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save. If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form,  and its Hit Dice and hit points change to match an average creature of its new form. These abilities and  statistics return to normal if the effect is later ended.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the spell's effect).}}

A bogun is a small nature servant created by a druid. Like a homunculus, it is an extension of its creator, sharing the same alignment and link to nature. A bogun does not fight particularly well, but it can perform any simple action, such as attacking, carrying a message, or opening a door or window. For the most part, a bogun simply carries out its creator's instructions. Because it is self-aware and somewhat willful, however, its behavior is not entirely predictable. On rare occasions (5% of the time), a bogun might refuse to perform a particular task. In that case, the creator must make a DC 11 Diplomacy check to convince the creature to cooperate. Success means the bogun performs the task as requested; failure indicates that it either does exactly the opposite or refuses to do anything at all for 24 hours (DM's option as to which).
A bogun cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator. It knows what its creator knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, up to a range of 500 yards. A bogun never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly. In that case, it does everything in its power to regain contact with its creator. An attack that destroys a bogun also deals its creator 2d10 points of damage. If its creator is slain, a bogun also dies, and its body collapses into a heap of rotting vegetation.
A bogun looks like a vaguely humanoid mound of compost. The creator determines its precise features, but a typical bogun stands about 18 inches tall and has a wingspan of about 2 feet. Its skin is covered with nettles and branches.
Combat: A bogun attacks by brushing against opponents with harsh nettles that deliver an irritating poison. Construction: Unlike a homunculus, a bogun is created from natural materials available in any forest. Thus, there is no gold piece cost for its creation. All materials used become permanent parts of the bogun.
The creator must be at least 7th level and possess the Craft Wondrous Item feat to make a bogun. Before casting any spells, the creator must weave a physical form out of living (or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the magical energy. A bit of the creator's own body, such as a few strands of hair or a drop of blood, must also be incorporated into this crude mannequin. The creator can assemble the body personally or hire someone else to do it. Creating this mannequin requires a DC 12 Craft (basketweaving or weaving) check.
Once the body is finished, the creator must animate it through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to complete. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from another sentient creature undoes the magic. If the creator is personally weaving the creature's body, that process and the ritual can be performed together.
When not actively working on the ritual, the creator must rest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping,or talking. Missing even one day causes the process to fail. At that point, the ritual must be started anew, though the previously crafted body and the grove can be reused.
On the final day of the ritual, the creator must personally cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun. These spells can come from outside sources, such as scrolls, rather than being prepared, if the creator prefers.}}

Bottle of Smoke(Spell Compendium): - Druid(3)
	/w gm &{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name}}} {{subtags=casts [Bottle of Smoke](https://dndtools.net/spells/spell-compendium--86/bottle-smoke--3988/) }} {{School:= Conjuration (Creation) }} {{Level:= **Druid 3**, Ranger 3}} {{Components:= V, S, AF}} {{Range:= Touch}} {{Effect:=One smoky, horselike creature}} {{Duration:=1 hour/level}} {{Savingthrow:=None }}  {{Spellresistance:=No }}  {{compcheck=Concentration: [[ {1d20+ [[ @{concentration} ]] }>[[?{Damage Taken|0}+15+0]] ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Success! @{subjective} casts @{possessive} spell!}} {{failcheck=@{subjective} fails @{possessive} concentration :( }} {{notes=<em>You wave an ornate bottle about and smoke twists into it, filling it with a white cloud.</em>
You create a plume of smoke that you capture in a special bottle you're holding. If the bottle is thereafter opened before the spell duration expires, the smoke emerges to form a vaguely horselike creature made of wisps of smoke. It makes no sound, and anything that touches it simply passes through it.
To mount this smoke horse, the would-be rider must make a DC 10 Ride check while holding the bottle in one hand. Anyone attempting to mount without the bottle simply passes through the horse's form. Letting go of the bottle after mounting causes the rider to fall through the horse's smoky form; he or she cannot thereafter remount without the intact bottle in hand. If the bottle is broken, the spell ends immediately and the rider (if mounted) falls to the ground.
The smoke horse has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can send smoke billowing out behind it at the rider's behest, leaving behind a bank of smoke 5 feet wide and 20 feet high as it moves. A severe wind, or magical wind of any kind, disperses the horse (and any smoke it has produced) instantly. Otherwise, the bank of smoke lasts 10 minutes, starting on the turn it was laid down. Starting or stopping the smoke trail is a free action. The mount and the smoke trail it produces give concealment to anyone behind them.
The mount is immune to all damage and other attacks because material objects and spells simply pass through it. It cannot attack.
The rider can return the smoke horse to the bottle, and thus pause the spell, at any time by simply uncorking it (a move action) and stoppering it again (another move action) in the next round after the horse is inside. If the bottle is reopened later, the spell reactivates with its remaining duration intact. Regardless of how much duration remains unused, the spell ceases functioning 24 hours after it is cast. If dispelled at any time while the bottle is corked, the spell ends.
<em>Focus:</em> An ornate, corked bottle worth at least 50 gp.}}

If the sphere enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for that round and tries to bowl over the creature with its wind force. That creature must resist a bull rush attack from the capricious zephyr, which has a +6 bonus on the check. If the spell wins the bull rush, it pushes the creature as far as it can in a random direction (roll 1d8; 1 indicates a push into the square closest to you, and 2 through 8 indicate the other squares, moving clockwise around the creature). Any creature pushed by the sphere must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.
A <em>capricious zephyr</em> moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you). Otherwise, it merely stays at rest and attempts to bowl over anyone in its square. The spell ends if the distance between the sphere and you ever exceeds the spell's range.}}

Each creature within range of the gaze must attempt a saving throw against the gaze effect each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature can avert its eyes, which grants a 50% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants you concealment relative to it. A creature can close its eyes or turn away entirely; doing so prevents the gaze from affecting it but grants you total concealment from that creature.
In addition, you can actively attempt to use the gaze as a standard action each round. To do so, you choose a target within range, and that target must attempt a saving throw. A target that is averting or shutting its eyes gains the above benefits.}}

You can use <em>dispel magic</em> to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. <em>Dispel magic</em> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the <em>dispel magic</em> can take effect. Thus, you can't use <em>dispel magic</em> to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/"><em>fireball</em></a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use <em>dispel magic</em> in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
<em>Targeted Dispel:</em> One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets <em>dispel magic</em> on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/"><em>haste</em></a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/"><em>mage armor</em></a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/"><em>bull's strength</em></a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the <em>haste</em>, <em>mage armor</em>, and <em>bull's strength</em> effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
<em>Area Dispel:</em> When <em>dispel magic</em> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <em>dispel magic</em> spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <em>dispel magic</em> spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
<em>Counterspell:</em> When <em>dispel magic</em> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, <em>dispel magic</em> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.}}

Medium or smaller creatures mus succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked 1d4&#215;10 feet away from the eye of the hurricane's center and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per10 feet traveled in this manner. Creatures blown away are knocked prone as well. Flying creatures are blown back 2d6&#215;10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.
Large creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6&#215;10 feet.
Huge creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be checked. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6&#215;5 feet.
Gargantuan and Colossal creatures can move through the spell's area without adverse consequences.
Even creatures that succeed on their saving throws must attempt them again whenever they start a turn inside the spell's area or whenever they move back into it.
The spell's area is effectively a sphere. Although the area is centered on you, you're not within the wind. if you move, the eye of the hurricane moves as well to keep you in the center. If you cast <em>eye of the hurricane</em> so that creatures are inside the eye when the spell begins, they must make Fortitude saves when your movement brings the area of wind upon them. Thereafter, if you move the spell area into a square occupied by another creature, that creature makes a Fortitude save at the beginning of its next turn (assuming the windy area of the spell is still on it).</}}

Because dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subjects also descends in this way if the <em>fire wings</em> spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by and <em>antimagic field</em>.

surges forward, sweeping away or smashing down nearly everything in its path.<br />The effect lasts for 1 round, although the water created by the spell does not disappear after 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground within the area cannot move or attack.<br />A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to successfully cast a spell.<br />The force of the water and debris deals those caught in the area 1d6 points of nonlethal damage plus another 1d6 points per five caster levels (maximum 4d6).<br />Any creature or object that is not soundly secured is pushed violently to the outer edge of the area.<br />If this forces the creature or object into a solid surface, it takes 8d6 points of damage.<br />A creature holding onto a sturdy object can make a DC 20 Strength check to avoid being moved.<br />A creature not already holding onto such an object can make a DC 20 Reflex save or Swim check to grab one.<br />A creature of Huge size or larger can make a DC 30 Strength check to dig in its feet and simply withstand the oncoming wave.<br />A creature that fails any of these checks falls prone in addition to being swept away.<br />The specific effect and aftereffects of a flashflood spell on the environment depend on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.<br />When the spell is completed, a total volume of 100,000 cubic feet of water (400 5-foot squares, in a 120-ft. cone, 10 feet deep) is left behind.<br />This water behaves like ordinary water&#8212;draining away and leaving puddles in most cases, or perhaps forming a shallow lake or pond.<br />Unless the caster has taken care to create the flashflood in a cleared area, however, the water left behind is full of debris, dirt, and perhaps a few corpses.<br />Such water is unfit to drink.<br />Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The sudden surge of water knocks down support beams, but otherwise has no real effect, aside from filling the tunnel with water to a depth of 10 feet.<br />If the area is insufficient to support 100,000 cubic feet of water, the water level rises above 10 feet until the entire volume is filled, or it spills outward from the confines of the original 400 squares.<br />What happens is based on the layout of the area.<br />In the case of level terrain, the water simply drains away over the course of a minute or so, leaving pools in depressions from which it cannot drain.<br />When the ground in a tunnel is not level, the water might flood sections of the tunnel.<br />In such cases, determine whether the flooded area is sufficient to contain the entire volume of water created&#8212;<br />and, if not, how deeply the water floods the next level up.<br />Any creatures caught in water over their heads might drown.<br />For example, Miyish casts flashflood in the dungeon of a ruined castle.<br />The dungeon's total volume is only 40,000 cubic feet (160 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling).<br />The remaining 60,000 cubic feet of water has to go somewhere, so it rushes up and out the entrance to the dungeon.<br />Since the terrain above the dungeon is another level of the castle, and is basically watertight, the water collects up here.<br />The total volume of this level is 80,000 cubic feet (320 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling), leaving 20,000 cubic feet of air.<br />Since the water has nowhere to go but up, and it has gone as high as it can, the water on this level is 7-1/2 feet deep (60,000 cubic feet divided by 8,000&#8212;the square footage of 320 5-foot squares).<br />If Miyish can't swim or breathe water, he has made a grave tactical error by casting flashflood in an area too small to contain it.<br />Cliffs: Casting flashflood at the base of a cliff has no effect on the cliff.<br />Casting flashflood from the top of a cliff can force creatures and objects over the edge, so that they take falling damage.<br />Open Ground: Creatures on open ground are safest from the worst effects of flashflood.<br />They might be knocked prone by the force of the water, or even swept 120 feet (24 squares) away, but they are not in any particular danger of drowning or being crushed.<br />Structure(s): Any structure standing on open ground takes 60 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden building, but not a structure built of stone, masonry, or reinforced masonry.<br />Hardness reduces this damage, but it isn't halved as damage dealt to objects normally is.<br />Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half).<br />The debris is swept away by the flashflood.<br />River, Lake, or Marsh: The river, lake, or marsh overflows its banks, though with rivers the effect is transitory.<br />In the case of lakes and marshes, determine how much the body of water overflows, given the 100,000 cubic feet of water added to it.<br />Only calculate this amount if the total surface area of the lake or marsh is less than 40,000 square feet&#8212;and even then, it's only academic unless it is important to determine whether something on the shore gets wet.}}

A moment later, a thin blue ray swirled with white streaks from your outstretched hand, leave a light fog in the air where it passes.</em>
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A target struck takes 2d6 points of cold damage. A creature struck must succeed on a Reflex save or be encased in a 5-inch-thick sheath of ice and be immobilized (and this helpless). A creature encased in ice takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round until freed. A target encased in ice is aware and breathes normally but cannot speak or move other tan to attempt to escape by making a Strength check (see below). It can still execute purely mental actions, such as using a spell-like ability. A spellcaster can cast a spell with no verbal or somatic component as long as the spell lacks a focus or material component, or the material component, focus, or divine focus is already in the spellcaster's hand.
The ice blocks line of effect. A winged creature cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim but because ice floats, the encase swimmer will rise to the surface and bob about.
A DC 22 Strength check breaks the ice, freeing the encased creature. Creatures other than the target can also attack the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 15 hit points. When the duration of the spell expires, the ice melts and the encased creature is freed. Damage that would harm the creature must first deal enough damage to destroy the ice before the creature takes damage, and damage dealt to the ice is subtracted from damage that would be dealt to the creature.}}

A Large bulbous, fleshy mass seethes into being around a single Medium or smaller target within range. The target can make a Reflex save to avoid becoming engulfed by the hungry gizzard, otherwise it is entombed within the disembodied digestive organ. If the target successfully saves, the gizzard immediately vanishes without further effect.
Each round a creature remains trapped inside a hungry gizzard (starting in the round the spell is cast), the target creature is considered grappled and takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage per round and 1d8 points of acid damage.
While engulfed, the target creature can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in hand, and it makes a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). An engulfed creature can cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once the creature exits, the gizzard immediately melts into a pool of blood and meaty chunks.
There is no immediate physical exit; the only way for those trapped inside to escape is to cut their way free, to dispel the spell, or to have allies outside destroy the gizzard. The gizzard is fairly easy to strike in combat from a vantage point outside of its interior, due to its size (AC 4). A newly formed hungry gizzard has 5 hit points per caster level. The gizzard is treated like an unattended object for the purpose of saving throws. A hungry gizzard reduced to 0 hit points is immediately destroyed.
Material Component: A dried gizzard.}}

A zone that exists in rings (such as the Gloaming in the Eldeen Reaches) has stronger effects as one moves inward; this spell increases the effect of a ring to that of the next inmost. The innermost ring of such a zone instead takes on one trait of the associated plane that it does not already have; in the case of the Gloaming again, the spell confers the mildly negative-dominant trait on that ring.

If the subject hits with its bite attack, it attaches itself to the foe and deals automatic bite damage each round it remains attached. It does not need to make a grapple check, and it does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An attached attacker loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. It cannot use other weapons while attached, but each attack upon from the grappled foe requires a successful grapple check. Others can attack an attached creature with a weapon or grapple. To remove the attached creature through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against it.
A creature with a natural bite attack can use its own bite damage, if greater, but still gains the ability to attach itself.

The creature targeted by this spell immediately takes 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. This drain manifests as a hardening of the limbs and skin as the victim's flesh slowly turns to wood. Each day that passes, the victim takes an additional 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. Even if drained points are restored (through restoration, for example), the target creature still takes Dexterity drain each day until the spell is lifted. Once a victim of jungle's rapture is drained to 0 Dexterity, it immediately transforms into a normal plant of the same size as its original body. Aside from radiating an aura of transmutation magic, the plant is a normal plant with no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores.
Jungle's rapture is a curse, and as such it cannot be dispelled. It can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if the caster level of that spell is equal to or higher than your caster level at the time you cast jungle's rapture.}}

If you succeed, the target becomes entangled in the thick strands of kelp and is grappled. Each round, the target can attempt to escape the kelpstrand by making a successful grapple or Escape Artist check against the kelpstrand's grapple check. You are not considered grappling yourself while using this spell. Once you shoot your strands of kelp, you need not take any action to maintain the effect.
A creature targeted with multiple kelpstrands has to make separate grapple or Escape Artist checks against each kelpstrand currently grappling it to escape. If you cast this spell while you are within 300 feet of the ocean shore, you gain a +4 bonus on any grapple checks made to determine the outcome of a kelpstrand grapple.

The animal must be your size category or larger. To any observer, you appear to leap and phase into the animal; you are gone, while the animal remains. For all intents and purposes, you no longer exist while merged with the animal, and you cannot be detected or affected by anything as long as you remain within it.
While melded with the animal, you mentally direct its actions. You can make it attack, run, or take any other action it could normally physically accomplish. However, because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it can undertake actions normally beyond its own instincts (such as manipulating objects with its claws or mouth). Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger) are ignored. You receive direct sensory input from the creature using its normal senses and skill modifiers.
You cannot take any mental actions while within the animal other than directing it or dismissing the effect (such that you cannot manifest a psionic power or cast a spell, even if it has no components).
Injury to the animal has no effect on you. If the animal is killed, if the spell is dispelled or dismissed, or if the spell's duration expires, you appear (as if leaping forth from the animal) in an open space of your choice within 10 feet of the animal's position. If no open space exists, you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet so moved.

You shape a natural setting into a formidable defensive position. Usually this spell is used to prepare an open outdoor area such as a hillside or a forest, but a large natural cavern could be shaped into a divine rampart. Artificial structures or features are not affected, although nature's rampart could be positioned to fill a gap between two buildings or barricade an unpaved road. The effect of the spell depends on the terrain:
<strong>Open Outdoor Site:</strong> A rampart or dike of earth 5 feet high and 5 feet thick at its base rises immediately behind a shallow ditch 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep along the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the dike receive cover. Attackers approaching on foot must scramble down into the ditch and then climbing 10 feet to reach the top of the dike (Climb DC 10).
<strong>Rough Outdoor Site or Cavern:</strong> Loose stones and boulders, dead wood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall 5 feet high and 2 feet thick at the base around the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the wall receive cover.
<strong>Marshy or Low-Lying Site:</strong> In areas such as marsh, bog, swamp, or tundra, nature's rampart cannot raise a wall, but instead creates a water-filled ditch 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep. Creatures forced to wade the ditch are reduced to 1/4 their normal speed (minimum 5 feet) and cannot charge or run.
Focus: A small quartz gem engraved with the image of an exquisite tiny castle, worth at least 100 gp.}}

The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration&#8212;the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.

Based on an assessment of your immediate surroundings and chosen path of travel, you receive one of three visions that reflect the next hour's journey: safety, peril, or great danger.
The base chance for receiving an accurate reply is 70% +1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly.
If the omen of peril is successful, you get one of three visions, which lasts just a second or two.
<ul><li>Safety: You aren't in any immediate danger.

You will likely face powerful NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour.</li></ul>If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don't necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly.
Choosing which vision is &quot;correct&quot; takes some educated guesswork on the part of the DM, who should assess the characters' likely courses of action and what dangers they're likely to face.
The exact form that an omen of peril takes depends on whether you worship a specific deity, venerate nature as a druid, or simply uphold abstract principles. A druid might see a white dove for safety, a dark cloud obscuring the sun for peril, and a forest fire for great danger. A cleric of Fharlanghn might get a vision of a straight road for safety, a crossroads for peril, and a washed-out bridge for great danger.
Unlike the more powerful <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/augury--2478/"><em>augury</em></a> spell (PH 202), an omen of peril doesn't respond to a specific question. It indicates only the level of danger likely for the next hour, not what form the danger will take.

You speak the words and feel the power of the plane buckle within your mind, then relax as you impress order upon the chaos.</em>
This spell grants temporary control over the terrain of Limbo. Normally, unless controlled, the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 158) is just what the plane's name implies: a roiling soup of energy and elements. Natives learn to control it or to inhabit areas that have enjoyed some measure of control for a long period, but visitors to areas of &quot;raw&quot; limbo must make a DC 16 Wisdom check to gain control over the dangerous roil.
The perinarch spell gives you automatic control of a radius of raw Limbo (an area not already stabilized or within some other creature's control) in close range. Control allows you to reshape the raw limbo as you desire, adding or subtracting one of the four basic elements once per round as a standard action. A favorite among travelers from the Material Plane is a chunk of earth surrounded by a small atmosphere of air.
The effect of this spell overlaps with the control already (potentially) established with a Wisdom check. Your allies can give their control over to you concurrently with the spell being cast, if they so choose. Control cannot be wrested away from you while the spell is in effect (which is one of the best reasons to cast this spell, even if you have a high Wisdom). If you move more than 100 feet away from the area that you controlled, the order you imposed fades away.
You are unable to achieve any works of complexity within an area you control, but you can mix two or three elements in a crude fashion; a few examples are provided below. You can attempt to seize control of a new area that already contains foes; however, foes can make a Reflex save to get out of the area.
<strong>Thick Barrier:</strong> You can &quot;thicken&quot; empty air with dust and rock, creating a zone around yourself and your allies that outside creatures must hack or force a way through. Their speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures.
<strong>Fiery Barrier:</strong> You can create a thick field of flame that deals 3d10 points of fire damage to any creature attempting to pass through it. The field also deals 3d10 points of fire damage for each round a creature lingers within it.
<strong>Complete Barrier:</strong> You can create a complete barrier of solid stone up to 1 foot thick encircling yourself and your allies, preventing access by any other than the most accomplished tunnelers. On the other hand, you can attempt to trap foes within their own bubble of solid stone.}}

When you cast this spell, a mass of avian shadows surÂ­rounds you, protecting you from attacks even as it grants you buoyant dexterity. The swirling shadows grant you concealment and soft cover (+4 to AC, but you gain no bonus on Reflex saves and cannot use your cover to make Hide checks). Furthermore, any creatures attempting melee attacks against you take 1d8 points of slashing damage from the raptor cloud. Creatures get no save against this damage, but spell resistance (if any) applies.
Creatures wielding reach weapons can attack you without taking damage, but creatures that have natural reach take damage as above.
Though a raptor cloud moves with you, you cannot deal damage with it by pushing it against creatures or objects. Only creatures that make melee attacks against you are subject to the cloud's defensive damage. However, you can elect to expend the spell's energy at any point by tarÂ­geting the raptor cloud against a single adjacent creature or object as a standard action. This attack deals 6d8 points of damage (Reflex half) and ends the spell.
A raptor cloud gives you a certain amount of lift as it swirls around you, granting you a +5 bonus on Jump and Tumble checks as you roll and weave through melee.

Shadow Landscape(Spell Compendium): - Druid(9)
	/w gm &{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name}}} {{subtags=casts [Shadow Landscape](https://dndtools.net/spells/spell-compendium--86/shadow-landscape--4145/) }} {{School:= Illusion (Shadow) }} {{Level:= **Druid 9**}} {{Components:= V, S, DF}} {{Range:= Long ([[400+floor(@{casterlevel2})*40]] ft)}} {{Area:=One-mile-radius spread centered on a point in space}} {{Duration:=24 hours/level (D)}} {{Savingthrow:=Reflex partial; see text }} {{Save DC:=[[@{spelldc9}+@{sf-Illusion}]]}} {{Spellresistance:=Yes }} {{CLC:= [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance. {{compcheck=Concentration: [[ {1d20+ [[ @{concentration} ]] }>[[?{Damage Taken|0}+15+0]] ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Success! @{subjective} casts @{possessive} spell!}} {{failcheck=@{subjective} fails @{possessive} concentration :( }} {{notes=<em>By infusing the nearby landscape with power stolen from the Plane of Shadow, you make the surrounding terrain a more savage, dangerous place.</em>
The spell's exact effects vary with the terrain upon which it is cast.
<strong>Desert:</strong> The spell transforms a desert into a place where no one goes willingly. The average temperature increases by 30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degrees if the desert is actually a tundra (see Cold Dangers and Heat Dangers, <span class="caps">DMG</span> 302&#8212;303). Sandstorms (or snowstorms if in a tundra) blow through a shadow landscape desert on an hourly basis.
<strong>Forest:</strong> Forests augmented with a shadow landscape spell become frightening places where a canopy of rotting leaves blocks the sun and all the trees are strangely twisted. Spaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth instead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/entangle--2807/"><em>entangle</em></a> spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC).
<strong>Hill:</strong> Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effect of a shadow landscape spell. Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope. Cliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25 Climb check to ascend or descend.
<strong>Marsh:</strong> Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding. Half the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 88).
<strong>Mountain:</strong> The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds. Cliffs and chasms require a DC 25 Climb check to scale. Creatures who fail Climb checks or make loud  noises have a 10% chance of starting an avalanche (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 90). Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, and anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet.
<strong>Plain:</strong> Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent. Half the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/entangle--2807/"><em>entangle</em></a> spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC).
<strong>Underground:</strong> Ordinary dungeons aren't affected by shadow landscape, but naturally occurring caverns are. Natural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10% of the available floor space.
In addition to terrain-specific effects, a shadow landscape spell worsens the weather within the spell's area. When rolling random weather (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 94), roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result. This effect does not apply underground.
You don't suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher Climb DCs, and so on) of a shadow landscape you created. When you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designated don't suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they're still subject to the bad weather.
You can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell's area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians. As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell's area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to cold 10, darkvision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and lowlight vision. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.}}

Extreme cold or heat, sunlight, or a remove disease spell destroys the green slime.

The feeling passes as you designate the area of the spell, where the flames there flicker for a moment as if a gust of wind had hit them.</em>
This spell lends fuel to existing fires within the spell's area, allowing them to burn off the intangible power of passion as much as from physical substance. Because these fires consume less of the physical fuel that sustain them, they burn for twice as long without losing any of their intensity, but their illumination radius is halved.
In addition, an affected fire is much harder to extinguish. It takes twice as long to put out a fire that is under the effect of this spell, and if a roll is required (such as the Reflex save required to extinguish flames if a creature is on fire), two successful rolls over 2 rounds are required to successfully put out the fire. If one such roll fails, the creature must begin trying to extinguish the flames again as if it had never succeeded on the first roll.
Magical fire used against a target in this spell's area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, does not burn as effectively, and fire damage from such sources is reduced by 1 point per die.
Slow burn counters or dispels the effect of <a href="/spells/spell-compendium--86/raging-flame--4055/"><em>raging flame</em></a> (page 164).

It must breathe, eat, and sleep just like a normal living creature (though the last two aren't likely to come into play thanks to the spell's short duration).
While it is under the effect of this spell, both negative energy (such as inflict spells) and positive energy (such as cure spells) heal damage to the undead creature, rather than damaging it.
An undead creature affected by this spell retains all of its other traits.}}

A set of ghostly dinosaur jaws come into being and attack the creature you designate.</em>
This spell creates a set of powerful jaws of force. The jaws attempt to grapple the designated opponent, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. The <em>spiritjaws</em> use your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) + your Wis modifier as it's attack bonus. If an initial attack hits, the <em>spirtjaws</em> deal 2d6 points of damage and attempt to start a grapple as a free action.  The jaws' bonus on grapple checks is equal to their attack bonus + 4.
Once the opponent is grappled, the jaws deal 2d6 points of damage with each subsequent grapple check. The target is considered to be grappling and can not move. The target creature no longer threatens squares and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against opponents not grappling it.
The set of jaws always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. Your feats do not affect the jaws. If the jaws move beyond the range of the spell, they vanish. Attacking the set of jaws has no effect. As a magical force effect, the jaws cannot be damaged, but <em>disintegrate</em> or a <em>sphere of annihilation</em> destroys it's effect.
The grappled opponent can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in band, and a Concentration check (DC20 + spell level) is made. A creature grappled by the set of jaws can attempt to escape by succeeding on a grapple check against the jaws or by making a successful Escape Artist check as a standard action opposed by the set of jaws' grapple check.
As a free action, you can direct the jaws to pin a grappled opponent instead of dealing damage with a grapple check. If the jaws win the opposed grapple check, the opponent is pinned. A pinned opponent is held immobile and must break the pin before it can escape the grapple. Creatures other than those grappling the pinned target gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls to hit it. If the jaws have multiple attacks (granted by your attack bonus), you can use them to cause damage to a pinned target or to make more grapple attempts against that target.
Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the <em>spiritjaws</em> to a new target. If you do not, the <em>spiritjaws</em> continue to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the <em>spiritjaws</em> switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the <em>spiritjaws</em> to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to.
If you become unable to command the jaws, they vanish.

1st Round: A storm of elemental fury buffets the area immediately beneath it with a whirling windstorm (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 94&#8212;95). Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible, and Small or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blown away.

2nd Round: Chunks of rock fall from the sky, dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save) to all creatures in the storm.
3rd Round: A deluge of rain extinguishes unprotected flames and perhaps protected ones as well (50% chance). The torrential downpour reduces visibility to 5 feet and cuts movement in half.

This spell creates a stalagmite about 1 foot wide at its base and up to 10 feet tall. If it encounters a ceiling before it reaches full size, it stops growing. The stalagmite grows from the ground under the target creature and shoots upward. An airborne creature within 10 feet of the ground gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw, and airborne creatures more than 10 feet above the ground cannot be harmed by this spell.
The stalagmite deals 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). In addition, a target that fails to make a saving throw against this spell and takes damage from it is impaled on the stalagmite and cannot move from its current location until it makes a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The stalagmite can be removed in other ways as well, such as with a stone shape spell. The victim can break free with a DC 25 Strength check, although doing this deals it 3d6 points of slashing damage.
A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from sudden  stalagmite is treated as piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.}}

The recipient can choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if rushed or threatened, and can use the run action while swimming if it swims in a straight line.
If the creature is carrying more than a light load, it must make Swim checks to move (taking the normal penalty for weight carried), but all other benefits of the spell still apply.

You transform natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of red-hot molten lava.

Creatures that fail their saves, or those unable to escape the area, take 20d6 points of fire damage in each round they remain in the area. Creatures in the lava have their speed reduced to 5 feet and take a &#8212;2 penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class. Even after leaving the area of the spell, creatures that were exposed to the lava take half damage (either 3d6 or 10d6) for 1 additional round.
If transmute rock to lava is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the lava falls to the floor and spreads out in a 15-foot-radius pool at a depth of approximately 1-1/2 feet. The rain of lava deals 2d6 points of fire damage to anyone caught directly beneath (Reflex half). In addition, creatures take 10d6 points of fire damage each round when they are caught in the area of the pool.
Although constructions of worked stone can't be targeted with this spell, casting it on unworked stone below or adjacent to such structures deals 10d6 points of fire damage per round to any part of the structure in contact with the lava. Wooden structures in contact with lava instantly burst into flame.
The lava cools naturally from its surface toward its center, and it no longer deals fire damage after 2d6 hours as it slowly reverts to stone. Though a 15-foot-radius pool can take as long as two days to completely cool, the core of a 10-foot cube of lava might remain molten for a month or more.

Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.
True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does  not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.

These forces of pure elemental power gather together a wall of water that moves inexorably in the direction of your choice, crushing all that it encounters.</em>
This spell creates a towering tsunami and sends it forth in a powerful wave to smash all in its path. The tsunami starts at any point you select within range of the spell and then moves at a speed of 60 feet in any direction chosen by you. Once the direction is set, the tsunami cannot change course. The tsunami deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all in its path. Anything struck can make a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Gargantuan or larger creatures that fail the save are knocked prone. Huge or smaller creatures that fail the save are picked up and carried with the wave. Each round a victim is carried by the tsunami, it takes the bludgeoning damage again and can make an additional Fortitude save for half damage. Creatures being carried by a tsunami cannot move in any other way. They can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in a tsunami take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. They can escape the wave by making successful DC 20 Swim checks, as long as they end their movement outside the effect of the tsunami.
Any creature that comes in contact with a tsunami as a result of movement during its turn is considered to have been struck by the tsunami's movement. A creature can attempt to extract another creature caught by a tsunami, providing the rescuer resists being swept up or knocked down by the tsunami and can reach the victim. Extracting a victim in this manner requires a DC 20 Strength check. 
A tsunami's progress can be halted by anything that would normally block line of effect along its path, assuming the tsunami does not destroy the intervening object or creature. If only a portion of the tsunami is blocked, the rest of it continues on.
Although this spell can be cast on dry land, it is most effective when cast on the open sea. In this case, saving throws to avoid full damage are made with a -4 penalty, and the width of the tsunami increases to 40 feet per caster level. A tsunami that begins on water but then travels onto land immediately shrinks to its land size and speed. A tsunami does not vanish if it moves beyond the spell's initial range.

A hit from the horn deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (if you are Medium) plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus.  The horn overcomes damage reduction as if it were a magic weapon.
Alternatively, you can use the horn in a charge attack. In this case, you deal double damage when you hit, or triple damage on a critical hit. 
As a swift action while the spell lasts, you can invoke the power of good.  Doing this gives the horn a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, allows it to overcome damage reduction as if it were good-aligned, and makes it deal an extra 3d6 points of damage against any evil-aligned creature of the following types: fey, giant, magical beast, or outsider.

This spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand. The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.
Creatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level).
Creatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located.
Any open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished.

This spell creates a 10-foot-thick wall of fresh water or seawater (as selected by you). The water forms around objects and creatures in its area, plunging these creatures and objects underwater. A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature's next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall.
Creatures can move through a wall of water by making Swim checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall.
Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location. Water brought out of the wall in a container instantly evaporates as the wall itself forms more water to replace what was removed.

This spell is a more potent version of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/whirlwind--2661/"><em>whirlwind</em></a> (PH 301). A greater whirlwind affects creatures differently, depending on their size and where they are in relation to the twister.
Near the Tornado: Large or smaller creatures who start their turn within 60 feet of the center of a greater whirlwind must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dragged 1d4Ã—10 feet toward the center of the twister, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet dragged.
Huge creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Gargantuan and Colossal creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save before moving away from the twister.
Flying creatures of Huge size or smaller that fail their Fortitude saves are sucked to the center of the twister, taking 2d6 points of damage from the battering and buffeting. Gargantuan flying creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be pulled 1d6Ã—10 feet toward the center of the twister. Colossal flyers must likewise make Fortitude saves or be pulled 1d6Ã—5 feet toward the twister's center.
Any Huge or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Large or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds. Any creature picked up is ejected 3 rounds later.
Inside the Tornado: Creatures that start their turn inside the tornado take 6d6 points of damage for each round they remain inside at the beginning of your turn. Creatures inside the tornado can't do much; attacks, spellcasting, and movement are impossible within a greater whirlwind. When the greater whirlwind ejects a creature, it reappears 4d6Ã—5 feet away from the twister's center in a random direction, and 4d6Ã—5 feet off the ground (immediately falling if it can't fly).
Terrain and Structures: The tornado uproots trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of dense rubble (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 90) wherever it goes. Structures within a greater whirlwind take 2d6Ã—10 points of damage per round. In a round or two, that amount of damage is sufficient to destroy any building made of materials less sturdy than reinforced masonry.
No ranged attacks can pass through the twister. A greater whirlwind extinguishes all flames it touches. Listen checks are impossible within a greater whirlwind.
A greater whirlwind remains stationary unless you direct it elsewhere as a move action. It moves up to 60 feet per round.}}

While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points. A 5th-level caster can create a wall up to 50 feet long and up to 25 feet high, sufficient to form a cylinder of wind 15 feet in diameter.

When you cast this spell, an insidious rot immediately taints any wooden object or plant creature you touch. Any unattended nonmagical wooden item smaller than 6 feet in diameter, or a 3-foot-radius volume of a larger wooden object (such as a wooden door), is instantly destroyed by wood rot.
In combat, you can use the spell to attempt to sunder any wooden or wooden-hafted weapon; the weapon or its wooden portion is destroyed on a successful melee touch attack. Attempting to sunder a weapon generally provokes attacks of opportunity, and wood rot has no effect on wooden or wooden-hafted weapons that strike you, even if you hold the charge.
Against wooden shields or armor, you also make a melee touch attack. Such targets too large to be destroyed outright take a -1d6 penalty to their armor or shield bonus on a successful hit and are rendered unusable if the penalty exceeds the bonus. Any attack against a wooden object discharges the spell, and wooden magic items are immune to the effect of wood rot.
Against plant creatures, wood rot deals 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15) on a successful attack. Against plant creatures, the spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round. Once it is used to make an attack against a plant creature, wood rot cannot be used to attack or destroy wooden items.

A wood wose is a translucent green nature spirit that you can command to perform simple natural tasks. It can build a campfire, gather herbs, feed an animal companion, catch a fish, or perform any other simple task that doesn't involve knowledge of technology. It cannot, for example, open a latched chest, since it doesn't know how a latch works.
A wood wose can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity if told to do so. Thus, if you commanded it to gather leaves, it would continue to do so while you turned your attention elsewhere, as long as you remained within range.
A wood wose has an effective Strength of 2, so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds. It can trigger traps, but the 20 pounds of force it can exert is not enough to activate most pressure plates. It has a land speed of 15 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet (perfect).
A wood wose cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll or a saving throw. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. If you attempt to send the wose beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.}}
