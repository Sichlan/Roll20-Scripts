The lights can be any color you choose, but the color cannot be changed once the spell is cast.
Handfire provides illumination equal to that of a candle, but it does not give off heat and cannot ignite objects.
Handfire can be used as a melee touch attack up to once per two caster levels.
Against a living creature, this attack deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
Against undead, handfire deals 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
It has no effect on targets that are neither living nor undead (such as constructs)}}

While under the effect of this spell, you gain certain characteristics of your animal form while remaining in humanoid form.
You gain the same damage reduction you have in animal form (normally 5/silver or 10/silver), the scent special quality, and the feats you have access to in animal form.
In addition, you gain one-half the adjustment for each ability score that you gain in animal form, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 2.
For example, if you are a werebear, you gain Str +8 (half of your animal form's +16) and Con +4 (half of +8), but no adjustment to your Dexterity because half of +2, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 2, is +0.
If you must make a Control Shape check while under the effect of this spell, you take a -4 penalty on your check}}

This wall need not be anchored to any surface, and creatures can readily pass through it.
Any undead creature that comes into contact with the wall takes 4d12 points of damage.
A creature of evil alignment, or any creature carrying the holy symbol of Shar or Umberlee, takes 2d10 points of damage.
Magic items that come into contact with the wall glow with a red faerie fire effect for 1d4+1 rounds.
The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet in all directions and creates shadowy illumination in a 40-foot radius.
The wall of moonlight counters and dispels any darkness spell of 4th level or lower within 40 feet of any part of it.
If you evoke the wall so that it appears in a spot occupied by creatures, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.
Wall of moonlight can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of at least 12th level at a cost of 2,000 XP}}

You can form the barrier either as a circular shield 5 feet in diameter and 10 feet high around a willing creature, or as a flat, 10-foot-square plane placed either horizontally (across a doorway, for example) or vertically (covering a pit or trap door), as long as it is anchored along at least one edge.
The barrier has an inside and an outside.
From the inside, it is transparent and passable; any creature can move through it.
From the outside, it is opaque and virtually impassable&#8212;no creature or attack can pass through from this direction.
Creatures inside the moonweb have cover and total concealment against attacks that originate on the outside}}
