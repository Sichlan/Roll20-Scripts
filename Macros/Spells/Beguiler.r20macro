The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
**1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras.
**2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
**3rd Round:** The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in  line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans).
Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created.
The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.
A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.
A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell}}

It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut).
If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes.
In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.
Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.
The effect is limited by the area.
A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot
door).
Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.
Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two knock spells}}

Any successful attack against an image destroys it.
An image's AC is 10 + your sizemodifier + your Dex modifier.
Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).
While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.
An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled.
If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect.
(Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded)}}

The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight.
An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (page 219).
If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each.
(Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect).
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

This extra speed has several effects.
When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round).
A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.
Multiple haste effects don't stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.
Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.
However, a suggestion that a pool of acid is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter.
Urging a red dragon to stop attacking your party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is a likewise reasonable use of the spell's power.
The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above.
If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.
For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

Creatures in the area move cautiously as they are caught up in the phantom melee.
This spell creates the illusion of a fierce battle.
Your enemies move cautiously and pass up the opportunity to strike their foes, since the roar and confusion of the battle distracts them.
All creatures within the area of the spell that fail their saving throws cannot make attacks of opportunity.
In addition, all creatures within the area are considered flanked.
A creature ignores these effects when it leaves the spell's area.
If a creature reenters the spell's area after leaving it, the creature can attempt another save to resist the spell if its initial save failed.
A creature that enters the area for the first time after the spell is cast must also make a saving throw to resist the effect.
A phantom battle spell produces noise appropriate to a mob of creatures locked in battle.
Anyone in the battle can plainly see that the conjured fighters are no threat, since they strike solely at other phantom warriors, but the din, tumult, and confusion make it difficult to focus on the true foes at hand.
A creature that succeeds on its save can still see the spectral outline of the illusion, but is able to block out the distraction and fight as normal.

An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern.
With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin).
All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect.
Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it.
If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), each fascinated creature gets a second save.
If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscuring mist spell, for instance), creatures who can't see them are no longer affected.
The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like).
A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
A creature can't take a 5-foot step while in solid fog.
However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.
Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone.
For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.
For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it.
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.
For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user.
Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item&#8212;

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.
If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).
Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81).
Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.
You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it}}

No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond.
Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).
If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged.
This decision must be made at the time of casting.
Rary's telepathic bond can be made permanent with a permanency spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of permanency.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow.
The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.
You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane.
Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end.
It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.
Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10&#215;100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint.
If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10&#215;1,000 feet in the same direction.
If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).
Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.
The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.
They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you).
Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful}}

Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.
True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does  not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.

The projected image mimics your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action).
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action.
While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.
If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you.
The projected image can't cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells.
The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image.
Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had succeeded on their Will save.
You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times.
If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends.
If you use dimension door, teleport, plane shift, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. Thus, a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/charm-person--2535/">**charm person**</a> spell cast at you could be turned back upon the caster and possibly enable you to use the charm effect on that individual, but a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> could not be turned back, and neither could inflict critical wounds.
From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The DM secretly rolls the exact number. When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left. 
When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected. 
For example, if you had three levels of spell turning left and were targeted by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/magic-missile--2631/">**magic missile**</a> spell heightened to 4th level, you  would turn three-fourths of the spell back at the caster. You would take one-forth of the damage, while the caster takes three-fourths of the damage. If you were targeted by a wizard's <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fear--2736/">**fear**</a> spell (also a 4th-level spell) in the same situation, you would have a one in four (25%) chance to be affected by the spell, while the caster would have a three in four (75%) chance to be affected.
If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by **spell turning** effects in operation, a resonating field is created.
Roll randomly to determine the result.

When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area.
The illusion created must be stated in general terms.
Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game.
You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area.
You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible.
Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.
Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed.
Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created.
A band of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance.
Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen.
Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another.
Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion}}

When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature.
You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.
Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.
