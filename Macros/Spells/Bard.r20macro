**1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras.
**2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
**3rd Round:** The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in  line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:
<table><tr><th>Original Strength </th><th>Duration of Lingering Aura </th></tr><tr><td> Faint</td><td> 1d6 rounds </td></tr><tr><td> Moderate</td><td> 1d6 minutes </td></tr><tr><td> Strong</td><td> 1d6Ã—10 minutes </td></tr><tr><td> Overwhelming</td><td> 1d6 days </td></tr></table>Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.
Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Thereafter, you can change the tempo, rhythm, or volume simply by concentrating for 1 round.
Bards often use this spell to provide background accompaniment for their own music and songs.
The sounds produced are no louder than real drums would be, but the effect is realistic enough to fool anyone who can't see that no drummers are present.

The creature can choose its own path and means of locomotion, but if it can, it must end its turn at least 10 feet closer to you than it started.
The creature defends itself normally and can take whatever actions it likes, so long as it moves closer to you every turn.
The creature can move toward you faster than 10 feet per round if it likes.
When the creature is adjacent to you, it acts normally unless you move away.
If you move away, it must move 10 feet per round closer to your new location if it can.
The beckon person spell lasts for at least 1 round, but it might last longer if you excel at the Truespeak check (described below).
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the truenames associated with movement and approach.
You learn these truenames when you learn this spell.
The Truespeak DC to cast this spell is 15; you add 2 rounds to the duration for every 5 points by which you exceed the DC}}

At one point during the duration of this spell, you can attempt to alter the outcome of a game of chance. This spell can affect only nonmagical games, such as those using cards or dice. It cannot affect a game involving magic, nor a magic item involved in a game of chance (such as a **deck of many things**). Whenever a dice roll is made to determine the outcome of the game, a character under the effect of this spell can demand a reroll and take the better of the two rolls.
Anyone observing the game of chance is allowed a Will saving throw to realize something fishy is going on, and might suspect that the outcome of the game has been magically altered. For example, Darkon is playing a game that he has a 1 in 4 chance of winning. The DM secretly rolls 1d4 and tells the player that Darkon lost. Because Darkon is under the effect of a **cheat** spell, the player can have the DM reroll. The spell alters probability, so there is no subterfuge that another character could notice (except for the casting of the spell itself)}}

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe.
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check.
A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion. For example, a creature that touched you and realized that the tactile sensation did not match the visual one would be entitled to such a save}}

Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a
fall froma few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect.
However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall.
Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.
You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn.
This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance.
If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.
(See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on falling objects).
Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects.
It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature}}

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area.
A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details). 
The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not). 
The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item&#8212;a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.
A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin. Material Component: A bit of pork rind or butter}}

Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: &quot;Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within a distance of one foot&quot;.
Triggers react to what appears to be the case.
Disguises and illusions can fool them.
Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does.
Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers.
Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says &quot;Boo&quot;).
Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible.
For example, &quot;Speak when any creature touches the statue&quot;
is an acceptable command if the creature is visible.
A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.
The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.
Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.
Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell}}

You gain proficiency with a single weapon or shield you hold in your hands when the spell is cast. The lack of a somatic component means the spell can be cast in the middle of a fight while you keep ready whatever items stand between you and danger.
Proficiency is granted for only a single, specific item, although multiple castings allow for multiple proficiencies. For example, if you hold a short sword and a rapier, with a buckler strapped to your off hand, you could cast the spell three times, once for each weapon and once for the shield.
This spell does not grant proficiency for a kind or category of item (such as short swords) but only for the one specific item held in your hand at the time the spell is cast (this short sword). Should you set that item down or otherwise lose your grip on it, the proficiency does not transfer to a different item of the same kind you might pick up.

With a sizzle and a flash, those within the spell's radius disappear, then reappear somewhere nearby.
The scramble true position spell can wreck an enemy's carefully constructed defenses or highly regarded plan of attack by randomly moving them around.
You can't control where your enemies reappear, but they might fall off a precipice or wind up between your rogue and fighter allies.
When you cast the spell, make a single Truespeak check.
Then compare your result to the DC to move each creature: 15 + (2 x CR).
If you meet or exceed the DC for a creature, move that creature 2 squares in a random direction using the &quot;targeted on square&quot; part of the diagram on page 158 of the Player's Handbook.
The scramble true position spell can't send a creature into a square occupied by solid matter or another creature, but it can send a creature into a dangerous place (into lava or off a cliff, for example).
Make the comparison and movement in descending CR order.
If multiple targets have the same CR, the caster chooses the order in which to relocate them.
If you can't move a target 2 squares in a particular direction, move it 1 square, or it disappears and reappears in the same square if relocation is impossible.
Having their true locations disrupted with this spell can be disorienting for the subjects.
Every creature that you move with this spell (even those who reappear in the same square they started in) must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the truenames for cardinal directions and movement, which you learn with the spell.
This check has no set DC, but if your Truespeak check result is lower than 15 + (2 x creature's CR) for the lowest CR creature in the area, then scramble true position has no effect}}

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. For instance, a celestial porpoise may only be summoned in an aquatic environment.
When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, a summon monster I is a lawful and evil spell when cast to summon a fiendish dire rat.

The new form must be within one size category of your normal size.  The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level.  You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.  You retain your own ability scores.  Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same.
You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.  Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.  You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind.  The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies.  The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.
Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you.  It advances and awaits your bidding.  You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain).  The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own.  You can attach some small item or note to the messenger.  The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.  Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored.  The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example)}}

The animated instrument cannot move.
It continues to play until the spell expires or the instrument is damaged.

This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as bless, good hope, and rage, as well as negating a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability.
It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets.
While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect.
When the calm emotions spell ends, the original spell or
effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime}}

For example, casting fortissimo on a singer and including her lute would make both her song and her accompaniment twice as loud.
If the affected creature or item can generate a sonic or language-based attack, such as a command spell, a harpy's song, the fascinate effect of bardic music, or a horn of blasting,

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell}}

You fill the subject with so great a rage that it can do nothing but focus on engaging you in personal physical combat. The target must be able to see you when you cast this spell. If the subject later loses line of sight to you, the spell immediately ends. (A subject can't voluntarily break line of sight with you, such as by closing its eyes, to end this spell prematurely.)
If the subject threatens you, it must make a full attack against you using a melee weapon or a natural weapon. If the subject doesn't threaten you at the start of its turn, it must move toward you (taking nothing but move actions) and end its movement as close to you as possible. If it gets close enough with a single move action to threaten you, it stops and makes a melee attack against you as normal.
While under the effect of a mindless rage spell, the subject can make use of all its normal melee combat skills, abilities, and feats&#8212;either offensive or defensive. However, the subject can't make ranged attacks, cast spells, or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger, or spell completion to function. The subject can't make any attack against a creature other than you.
The subject of this spell, though overcome with rage, is by no means rendered idiotic or suicidal. For example, an affected creature will not charge off a cliff in an attempt to reach you.
An interesting side effect of mindless rage occurs when the spell affects any character or creature that has the rage ability (such as a barbarian). In these cases, the mindless rage spell automatically activates the creature's rage ability (and counts as one of the creature's uses of rage for that day)}}

You can move into and through a mirror image.
When you and the mirror image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image.
The figments may also move through each other.
The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets.
Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment.

Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).
While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.

On casting the spell, you choose another object within range.

(Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect).
Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save.
For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth.

Portal alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size passes through the magic gate or portal the spell is cast upon. You decide at the time of casting whether the portal alarm will be mental or audible.
<strong>Mental Alarm:</strong> A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) as long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area and on the same plane. You notice a mental tremor that would awaken you from a normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration (it would not interfere with spellcasting). A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.
<strong>Audible Alarm:</strong> An audible portal alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, buzzer, or other similar repeating sound that can be heard clearly up to 60 feet away, and it pierces closed doors and extends onto other planes. The ringing can be heard faintly up to 180 feet away and lasts for 1 round. Creatures within the area of a silence spell cannot hear the ringing, and if the portal itself is within the area of a silence spell, no alarm is sounded.
Ethereal and astral creatures trigger a portal alarm if they pass through the portal.
You can set a portal alarm with a password, determined at the time of the casting, and this password can be discerned with the <a href="/spells/spell-compendium--86/analyze-portal--3826/">**analyze portal**</a> spell (page 10). Those speaking the password before passing through the portal do not set off the alarm.

This spell only works on a portal you are able to activate; for example, if you are an elf and the target portal doesn't work for elves, you can't use this spell on the portal.
The extradimensional space created by this spell is similar to that created by a rope trick spell but can only hold you and your gear (up to your maximum heavy load).
When the spell ends, you exit the portal at either your point of entry or the portal's destination.
While within this extradimensional space, you can see the origin and destination locations, though the images are blurry (much like viewing the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane).
Dispel magic or gate seal traps you within the extradimensional space for as long as the portal is negated or sealed (as would surrounding both ends with a dead magic area).
Mordenkainen's disjunction or some other effect that destroys a portal outright forcibly ejects you from one random end of the portal and deals 5d6 points of damage to you.
This spell originated in Shaundakul's church and is hard to
find elsewhere.

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. When this ray successfully strikes, it creates a sensation of many tiny insects biting and crawling on the victim's body. The target can attempt a Will save each round to shake off the effect. Until the spell is shrugged off, the victim is hampered by the unsettling feeling of all the stinging and biting, and is able to perform only a single move or standard action each round. The victim also takes a -2 penalty to AC. In addition, if the victim attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check with a DC equal to the sting ray's DC + the level of the spell the subject is attempting to cast. For example, if a 6th-level sorcerer with a Charisma score of 16 casts sting ray on a wizard casting a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a>, the Concentration check DC is 19 (16 [sting ray DC] + 3 [fireball spell level]).
A successful Will save negates the effect restricting the subject's action to one move or one standard action each round, nor does the subject need to make a Concentration check each time it wishes to cast a spell. However, the subject still takes the penalty to AC for the duration of the spell with a successful save.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.
Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.
However, a suggestion that a pool of acid is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter.
Urging a red dragon to stop attacking your party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is a likewise reasonable use of the spell's power.
The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above.
If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.
For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

You can tell whether an area contains a magical portal or the effect of a gate spell. If you study an area for 1 round, you know the sizes and locations of any such portals in the area. Once you find a portal, you can study it. (If you find more than one portal, you can study only one at a time.) Each round you study a portal, you can discover one property of the portal, in this order.
- Any key or command word needed to activate the portal.
- Any special circumstances governing the portal's use (such as specific times when it can be activated).
- Whether the portal is one-way or two-way.
- A glimpse of the area where the portal leads. You can look at the area where the portal leads for 1 round; the range of your vision is the spell's range. Analyze portal does not allow other divination spells or spell-like abilities to extend through the portal. For example, you cannot also use detect magic or detect evil to study the area where the portal leads while viewing the area with analyze portal.
- For each property, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 17. If fail, you can try again in the next round. Analyze portal has only a limited ability to reveal unusual properties, as follows.
- Random Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is random and whether it can be activated now. It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning.
- Variable Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is variable. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set.
- Creature-Only Portals: The spell reveals this property. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals where the portal sends creatures. If it is the kind of portal that sends creatures to one place and their equipment to another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes.
- Malfunctioning Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is malfunctioning, not what sort of malfunction the portal produces}}

You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.
Blinking has several effects, as follows.
Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible.
If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).
If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%.
(For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance).
Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.
Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures.
Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.
While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.
You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects.
For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material.
If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.
You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material).
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.
You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost.
An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down.
As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial.
Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally.
Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.
An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack.
Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material}}

A double of you appears nearby.
You create a fetch, a perfect replica of your form at the time you cast this spell.
Little more than an animated reproduction, a fetch is mindless but capable of performing simple tasks or imitating you.
The creation is the same size as you and occupies space just as a living creature does.
You have a mental connection with your fetch and can give it new orders as a standard action.
The fetch duplicates your form in every way but texture.
You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is; this result is opposed by observers' Spot checks as normal.
Anyone touching the fetch finds it rubbery and soft, and in so doing immediately realizes its magical nature.
The fetch's body includes useless versions of all the equipment you possess: A weapon wielded by the fetch is too flimsy to deal damage, and tools it carries are fragile and imprecise.
Items created with a fetch are part of its form and dissipate if separated from it.
At your order, the fetch can retrieve things for you, open unstuck doors, hold chairs, and the like, as well as perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending.
The fetch can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a skill that can't be used untrained.
It can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity tirelessly if ordered to do so as long as you remain within the spell's range.
You can have the fetch imitate you, such as by sitting at a desk and pretending to write, lying in bed and breathing deeply, or skulking with a weapon drawn.
It can even imitate tasks it can't actually perform, though it automatically fails any attempt at such performance&#8212;for instance, even though a fetch can pretend to decipher an ancient text, it can't actually do it.
The fetch weighs roughly the same as you do, so it can trigger any traps you would if you were to pass through the same space, setting off tripwires, pressure plates, some magical forms of detection, and similar devices.
Its land speed is normal for a creature of your kind (for example, 30 feet for a human or 20 feet for a halfling).
Even if you normally have other modes of movement available (such as a fly or swim speed), the fetch can't use those.
The fetch automatically fails any saving throw required of it.
If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.
The fetch has an effective Strength score of 6, so it can lift 60 pounds or drag 300 pounds.
Its Dexterity is 10, so it has an AC of 10 (plus size modifier).
It gains no AC benefit from any equipment or effect on you when the spell is cast (such as armor you wear, since the armor created for it is part of its form), though it can then wear real armor or other items to increase its Armor Class.
It has no Constitution score and 10 hit points; if reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
It can't be healed, nor can it benefit from temporary hit points.
The fetch has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score.
You can command it to make noise, but it can't communicate in any way, nor can it understand instructions other than the simple orders you give it telepathically.
The fetch cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll.

If disobedience ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller becomes able to mentally command the targeted creature.

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you.
While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.
The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.
If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions (such as &quot;Wait here&quot; or &quot;Defend this area against attack&quot;), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level.
A clever recipient can subvert some instructions: For example, if you order the recipient to protect you from all harm, it might place you in a nice, safe dungeon for the duration of the spell.
If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores.
Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of &#8211; 8.
No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect.
The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas.
A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round).
A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw.
A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation.
Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast.
The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.
Typical suggestions include &quot;Close the book and leave&quot;, &quot;Forget the existence of the book&quot;, and so forth.

The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.

While druids and rangers are the classes most often known to cast this ancient spell, its magic is nearly universal and can be mastered by all spellcasting classes.
When you cast this spell, you trace the cerulean sign in the air with a hand, leaving a glowing blue rune in the air for a
brief moment before it flashes and fills the area of effect with a pulse of cerulean light.
Any aberration within the area must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the following ill effects.
Closer aberrations are affected first.
Each effect lasts for 1 round.
None: The aberration suffers no ill effect, even if it fails the
saving throw.
Sickened: The aberration takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round.
Nauseated: The aberration cannot attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything but take a single move action for 1 round.
Dazed: The aberration can take no actions, but has no penalty to its Armor Class, for 1 round.
Stunned: The aberration drops everything held, can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round.
Once a creature recovers from an effect, it moves up one level on the table.
Thus, a creature that is stunned by this spell is dazed the round after that, nauseated the round after that, sickened the round after that, and then recovers fully the next round}}

You see luminous words appear in the air above your spell's target. The words describe the creature's strengths or weaknesses, as you desire.**
You gauge the strengths and weaknesses of an opponent to gain combat advantages. Upon casting this spell, you learn a number of strengths or weaknesses of the target equal to one, plus one strength or weakness per two caster levels (maximum four). You can choose to learn strengths, weaknesses, or some combination thereof that you specify. If a creature has more strengths or weaknesses than you can learn with a single casting, you learn the most powerful ones first. Thus, if a monster can use finger of death at will and has resistance to sonic 5, you would learn about finger of death first.
Strengths can include attack forms and special abilities (including spell-like abilities or supernatural abilities). Weaknesses include vulnerability to an energy type.
For example, suppose a 7th-level cleric casts know opponent on a black-armored warrior, choosing to learn one strength and two weaknesses. The warrior fails his save, and the DM informs the cleric's player that the opponent has the ability to drain energy (a strength), is adversely affected by sunlight, and can be repelled by a holy symbol (both weaknesses).

However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
The temperature inside the hut is 70Â° F if the exterior temperature is between 0Â° and 100Â° F.
An exterior temperature below 0Â° or above 100Â° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus, if it's -20Â° outside, inside the hut it's 50Â°).
The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms.
The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere.
You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired.
Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within.
Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through
the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet.
It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level.
A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.
10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).

When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.
Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it.
The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike.
If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise.
If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed.
While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells.
It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings.
It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury.
However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.
The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical.
A dispel magic can remove the sigil.
An erase spell destroys the entire page of text.
Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells
that hide or garble text, such as secret page.

You can reach into the Plane of Shadow through the portal created by shadow cache, but only small, nonliving objects can pass entirely through the hole. The cache can hold up to 30 cubic feet of material, or 250 pounds.
You can recover objects placed in the portal throughout the duration of the spell, or by casting another hadow cache later. A shadow cache remains stationary at the point where you create it. Items placed in a shadow cache can possibly be picked up by natives of the Plane of Shadow, and in any event are slowly moved by the morphic trait of the plane.

This flight will be by the safest means possible, withdrawing from combat, fighting defensively, and not passing through threatened areas.
The target will only fight if someone actively attempts to prevent it from following through with its search for the ocean; if this fight is with an ally, the target is granted a second saving throw to throw off the effects of the spell.
In some environments, this means that those affected simply flee in the direction of the nearest coast.
Along a shoreline, targets often plunge into the surf.
Aboard ship, they leap overboard.
If the subject has no idea where to find a substantial body of water, it simply chooses a random direction and continues until the spell expires.

Because the magic of the spell only causes the subject to blink when attacking or casting, attackers have no miss chance against her, and spells cast against her affect her normally.
Because the blinking is so rapid, she cannot attempt to blink through walls or move in the Ethereal Plane.

Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone.
For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.
For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it.
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.
For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user.
Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item&#8212;

However, dispel water cannot counter an instantaneous spell or effect.
You choose to use dispel water in one of three ways: to dry up a body of water, to counter a water-based spell or effect, or to dismiss an extraplanar creature of the water subtype.
Dry Up Water: This effect instantly destroys 200 cubic feet of water per level.
Remaining water rushes in to fill the void.
Cast in a large body of water, such as an ocean, the destruction of 1,000 or more cubic feet of water produces a strong current that pulls boats and creatures down.
Creatures caught in the current must make a DC 20 Swim check to avoid going under.
A creature that fails the Swim check is pulled down to a depth of 10 feet per caster level and must hold its breath or begin to drown (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
The current might capsize vessels: The chance is 95% for a craft shorter than 20 feet long, 50% for one from 20 to 60 feet long, and 20% for one over 60 feet long.
Counterspell:Used in this way, dispel water targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (see page 170 of the Player's Handbook).
It only counters spells and spell-like abilities that have the water descriptor, or appear on the Water domain spell list, or clearly involve water (such as create food and water, sleet storm, and wall of ice).
To successfully counter the other spell, you must make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level.
Dismiss Water Creature: Cast in this way, dispel water targets a single extraplanar creature of the water subtype within range.
The creature can negate the effect with a successful Will save (and its spell resistance, if any, applies).
If it fails to save or resist the spell, the creature is forced back to its home plane}}

The caster can create one large cloud of flickering motes or several smaller clouds.

Conversely, the caster can group one or more 10-foot-cubes together to form larger clouds or barriers.

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.
If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).
Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81).
Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.
You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it}}

You instantly swap locations with a projected image.
You always arrive exactly where your image previously stood, and you leave a projected image in your wake.
To anyone incapable of discerning that the projected image is an illusion, the image swap occurs without visible clue.
To anyone capable of discerning that the projected image is an illusion, the image swap is effectively identical to a dimension door.
This spell has no effect if you do not have a projected image in effect.
Unlike normal teleport spells, use of Halaster's image swap does not count as breaking one's line of sight with a projected image.

An undead creature hit by such an attack can use spell resistance against the effect and is allowed a Will save for half damage.

If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4&#215;10 minutes.
If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).
During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth.
When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind.
These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known.
If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information.
As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are &quot;legendary&quot;, as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.
Examples of legend lore results include the following.
A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: &quot;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones.
Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'
on the lips&quot;.
A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: &quot;Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life.
He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain&quot;.
(The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain).
A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: &quot;The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods.
Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day&quot;.
(These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore)}}

Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.
A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much it enjoyed drinking poison, is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine.
More useful applications of modify memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you (inclining the subject to act favorably toward you), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that it ever saw you or your party.
The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject}}

For example, if a poison has dealt 3 points of Constitution damage to a character and threatens to deal more damage later, this spell prevents the future damage but does not repair the damage already done.
The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration&#8212;the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.
This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the caster's option.

Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.
Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.
Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.
Spells that deal damage, such as Melf's acid arrow, have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save.
Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack.
If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur.
Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.
In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not.
Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mist, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.
Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.
A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy).
It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses.
Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work.
(Roll for each use and each affected character separately).
Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11).
A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.

You take only half damage from falling, since you are subject to gravity only while you are on the Material Plane.
You can ready an action to blink away from a specific enemy attack, physical or magical.

The sword moves with the creature it fights for (and so can take the full attack action if that creature does), staying within 5 feet at all times and dropping to the ground if that creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.
Controlling the sword requires no concentration, and the designated creature can fight with another weapon at the same time.
A dancing blade prevents two opponents from flanking the creature it fights for (though that creature can be flanked by additional opponents).

At any point during the spell's duration you can teleport (as the greater teleport spell) back to the mark as a swift action.
This ends the spell's duration.

You have no knowledge of whether your mark has been moved or where, and upon teleporting to its location, you are subject to any adverse conditions.
If the mark has been moved to another plane, any attempt to teleport to it fails.
If the object inscribed with the evacuation rune is moved somewhere too small for you to appear or is otherwise covered by a solid body, you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location.

However, you are capable of controlling the timing of your blinks and therefore make better use of them.
Blinking by means of this spell has several effects: Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help the attacker.
If the attack is capable of striking invisible or incorporeal creatures, the miss chance is only 20%.
An attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures takes no penalty.
You have no chance of interfering with your own attacks.
Individually targeted spells have a 50% chance to fail against you while blinking, unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures.
You have no chance of interfering with your own spells.
You take only half damage from area attacks (or full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
While blinking, you strike as an invisible creature (+2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.
You take only half damage from falling, since you are subject to gravity only while you are on the Material Plane.
You can ready an action to blink away from a specific enemy attack, physical or magical.
If you do so, the attack misses automatically unless it can
also affect ethereal targets.
You move at three-quarters speed, since movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.
While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects.
You do not risk materializing inside a solid object unless you actually end your move inside one, in which case you materialize and are shunted off to the nearest open space.
You take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet traveled in this manner.
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.
You interact with ethereal creatures in roughly the same way you interact with material ones (their attacks have a 50% miss chance against you, and so on)}}

The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage.
The nightmare leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.
The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.
Dispel evil cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the nightmare and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the dispel evil.
If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting.
If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell (see page 69) or the spell ends.
If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.
You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance.
(You always fail any saving throw, for example).
Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or dream are immune to this spell}}

Under its effects, a good creature might commit acts of extraordinary evil without any feelings of remorse.
For instance, a paladin who strives to never destroy a foe that has surrendered might decide that she's better off meting out justice immediately and killing the enemy.
This spell affects the target's norms and expections; for example, once affected, a good-aligned target might be willing to attack his friends when urged to do so through a suggestion.
This would not eliminate his need to atone, according to the tenets and punishments prescribed by his faith or law.
The compulsion is permanent until broken by a break enchantment spell or similar magic, or until it is removed by the spellcaster.
Material Component:One piece of masterwork artwork of at least 1,000 gp in value.
The artwork must depict acts of debauchery or evil that are titillating and fascinating, not disturbing or revolting.

The mists within the reflective surface dissipate, and suddenly you can see and hear a familiar place.
You can see and hear what occurs at a location, which can be at any distance on the same plane where you are located.
You must make a successful caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) to scry a specific location.
The difficulty of this check depends on how familiar you are with that location and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that place.
Furthermore, the difficulty to scry the desired locale increases if the location is extremely far removed, indoors or underground, or on another plane.
The DC of this check is 20 + any modifiers related to your knowledge of the area, your connection to it, and the location's distance, as set out in the following table.
If you fail this check, the scrying attempt simply fails.
If the caster level check succeeds, you create an invisible magical sensor in any location you desire.
Through this sensor you can both see and hear, your vantage and range of vision being the same as if you were actually at that place, allowing you to make Spot and Listen checks as normal.
You can rotate the sensor as you wish, seeing in any direction you desire.
Once the spell is cast, however, you cannot change the position of the sensor.
As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects.
In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message.
If the caster level check fails, you can't attempt to scry on any place within 1 mile of that location until 24 hours have passed}}

(For a spell with more than one level, use the best one applicable to you).
Spells that deal damage, such as lightning bolt, have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save.
Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack.
If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur.
If recognized as a shadow evocation, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage.
Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow evocation's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.
Nondamaging effects, such as gust of wind, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow.
The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.
You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane.
Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end.
It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.
Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10&#215;100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint.
If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10&#215;1,000 feet in the same direction.
If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).
Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.
The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.
They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you).
Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful}}

Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
As you cast the spell, a ghostly, grasping hand appears to reach inside your foe, pull out a black, cloudy mass before disappearing.
This spell functions as spurn the supernatural, except that its effect is permanent and it eliminates only one supernatural ability, no matter how high your Truespeak check.
Your target loses the chosen supernatural ability until it undergoes a ritual of renaming or is the target of a wish or miracle spell.
If the subject has a temporary supernatural ability (such as those granted to binders by vestiges), it loses that ability, but this spell does nothing to prevent the subject from gaining the same or other supernatural abilities later.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the personal truename of the creature you're targeting.
XP Cost: 500 XP}}

**Panicked:** The subject becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.
**Comatose:** The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a sleep effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

If the target dies before completing the obligation, the geas transfers to his closest adult relative.
This new subject is entitled to a save; if she succeeds, the geas is broken and the spell ends.
If not, she labors under the geas until she either completes the obligation, succeeds in dispelling the geas, or dies and potentially passes the geas to her closest adult relative.
Each new subject has an instinctive understanding of the nature of the obligation.
A familial geas can be broken only by a successful save on the part of the next successor, remove curse (if cast by someone two caster levels higher than the familial geas), miracle, or wish}}

The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a maze spell.
Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale.
Thus, the subject could not find the way to &quot;a forest where a green dragon lives&quot; or &quot;a hoard of platinum pieces&quot;, but it could find the exit to a labyrinth.
The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take.
For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph of warding.
The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.
Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round.
This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians)}}

**Years:** You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one year per caster level. You notice only noteworthy events such as deaths, battles, scenes of great emotion, important discoveries, and significant happenings.
**Centuries:** You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one century plus an additional century for every four caster levels beyond 1st.

At the same time, as the snow strikes their bodies, it melts and washes away scars, wounds, and filth.
Allies under the effect of the snow gain a +4 morale bonus to Charisma and attack rolls, and a +4 insight bonus to Armor Class.

All melee attacks made by allies in the snowsong deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage.
Enemies in the area of a snowsong have a much different experience.
To them, the snow is bitterly cold and leaves scabs and angry welts when it lands their skin.

Distant chords of a harsh and terrible symphony&#8212;as if multiple orchestras played different pieces simultaneously&#8212;echo continuously in the air as you reach for your victim.**
A creature targeted by this spell loses the ability to dream during sleep or rest. Rather, in place of dreams, the subject's slumbering mind is filled with the sounds of a discordant orchestra. After the victim's first attempt to sleep, it incurs a -2 penalty on Wisdom-based skill checks. This penalty persists as long as the symphonic nightmare maintains its hold. This spell affects all creatures that sleep or enter sleep-like trances, although creatures without the need to sleep are effectively immune.
In addition, the creature's sleep is now haunted. It can no longer gain complete rest from sleeping or resting. The subject does not regain hit points or heal ability damage naturally, nor is it able to prepare spells if doing so requires a full night's rest.
The creature is, however, now immune to the dream and nightmare spells, as well as to other effects that cause nightmares (such as the night hag's dream haunting ability).
You can lift the effect of this curse at will, but it is otherwise difficult to remove a symphonic nightmare before its duration expires. A remove curse cast at a higher caster level than the symphonic nightmare spell removes it, as does a successful break enchantment. Otherwise, a wish or miracle is required to lift the curse.
This spell can also be cast on a creature you are scrying, or on a creature distant from you if you hold something the creature carried within the past 24 hours}}
