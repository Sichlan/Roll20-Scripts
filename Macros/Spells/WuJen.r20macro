The writing can be visible or invisible.
An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance (even stone or metal) without harm to the material upon which it is placed.
If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.
See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark.
A read magic spell reveals the words, if any.
The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.
If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.
Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting Drawmij's instant summons on the same object (see that spell description for details)}}

**1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras.
**2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
**3rd Round:** The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in  line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
**Aura Strength:** An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).

You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans).
Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created.
The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.
A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.
A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour.

A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material.
It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round.
It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters.
Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial.
The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.
Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.
Characters typically use prestidigitation spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives.
Common tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs}}

The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it&#8212;it does not snake outward&#8212;so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inchdiameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.
The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
**1st Round:** Presence or absence of evil.
**2nd Round:** Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.
**3rd Round:** The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. 
**Aura Power:** An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. 
For example, as indicated on the table, an evil outsider with 12 HD has an overwhelming aura of evil. A good cleric who casts this spell and directs it at the location of such a creature for longer than 1  round loses the spell and is stunned for 1 round if his character level is 6th or lower.

If **detect evil** is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them.

The spell melts normal ice and snow automatically (no saving throw or spell resistance allowed); melted ice creates an equivalent volume of water that flows and spreads according to its location.
Melted snow creates a volume of water equal to one-tenth its original volume (so that a 10th-level wu jen melting ten 10-foot cubes of snow would create a single 10-foot-cube volume of water in its place).
In both cases, depending on the local temperature, melted ice or snow might begin to freeze again once the water stops flowing, possibly creating a movement hazard.
Against cold creatures, the spell deals 2 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10 points), or half damage on a successful Fortitude save.
Against magically created ice or snow (like that generated by wall of ice), the spell deals the same damage (possibly smashing or breaching the ice) but does not melt it.
Cold creatures apply spell resistance, if any.

Its speed is 15 feet.
The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll.
It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks.

You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.  You retain your own ability scores.  Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same.
You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.  Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.  You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind.  The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell}}

If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes.
In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.
Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.
The effect is limited by the area.
A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot
door).
Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.

The wielder can use the blade to deal electricity damage with a melee touch attack, or to fire a 30-foot line of lightning as a ranged touch attack.
During the spell's duration, the blade can deal up to 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
For each attack roll, the blade's wielder decides how many dice of damage the blade will deal on a successful hit, up to the maximum damage potential remaining in the spell.
On a successful attack, the blade deals the specified damage to the target.

Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights.

Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice.

The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (&quot;planes&quot;).
Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes.
The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size).
Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope &quot;disappear&quot;.
In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space.
The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds.
A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.
Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it.
Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope.
The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it.
Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.
The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time.
The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

&quot;Unclear&quot; is a legitimate answer, because spirits are not necessarily omniscient, but in cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the spirit's interests, the DM can respond with a short phrase (five words or less) instead.

You can use **dispel magic** to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. **Dispel magic** can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the **dispel magic** can take effect. Thus, you can't use **dispel magic** to repair damage caused by a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/">**fireball**</a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.
You choose to use **dispel magic** in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
**Targeted Dispel:** One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets **dispel magic** on a drow who is under the effects of <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/">**haste**</a>, <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/">**mage armor**</a>, and <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/">**bull's strength**</a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the **haste**, **mage armor**, and **bull's strength** effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
**Area Dispel:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the **dispel magic** spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
**Counterspell:** When **dispel magic** is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, **dispel magic** may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell}}

Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the **fireball** at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must &quot;hit&quot; the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
The **fireball** sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round).
A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.

Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as illusory script.
Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw.
A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation.
Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast.
The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.
Typical suggestions include &quot;Close the book and leave&quot;, &quot;Forget the existence of the book&quot;, and so forth.
If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear.
The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.
The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it.
A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward.
When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle.
The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries.
If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.
A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap.
If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends.
The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can.
If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day.
If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.
A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.
You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.
If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does.
The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can.
The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure.
Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check.
The DM makes this check secretly.
If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective.
You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.
This task also takes 10 full minutes.
If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell.
The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level.
A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.
If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5.
The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&#8212;even a straw laid across it.
However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.
This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa}}

Once per round on a successful ranged touch attack, the magnetic ray can draw an object toward you with an effective Strength score of 30 (and so can target items weighing up to 8,000 pounds).
Any unattended and unsecured item flies directly and safely to your hand (or to the edge of your space if too large to be wielded), but drawing an item toward you that another creature is holding (such as a weapon) requires a successful disarm attempt (see page 155 of the Player's Handbook).
You use the ray's Strength modifier (+10) in place of your own, and such attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if you use magnetism against a creature in an adjacent square, although casting the spell might still provoke attacks of opportunity.
If you succeed on the disarm attempt, the weapon flies from your opponent's hand to your own.
If you target an item that is attended but not held, such as a weapon at someone's belt, the creature bearing the item gets a Reflex save to hang onto it, dropping whatever else is in one hand at the time unless it has a free hand.
On a failed save, the item flies from the creature's hand to your own.
Otherwise, make a disarm attempt as above.

(A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).

The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level.

**Skeletons:** A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons.
**Zombies:** A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

The sword must be either unattended (in which case you choose which creature it will fight for, so long as both creature and weapon are within range) or in the possession of a willing ally who benefits from the spell.
A dancing blade attacks using the initiative modifier and base attack bonus of the creature it fights for, though it gains no other attack or damage modifiers the creature might have (including those from Strength) and takes a -4 penalty on its attack rolls if the creature it fights for doesn't have proficiency with a weapon of its kind.
The sword moves with the creature it fights for (and so can take the full attack action if that creature does), staying within 5 feet at all times and dropping to the ground if that creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.
Controlling the sword requires no concentration, and the designated creature can fight with another weapon at the same time.
A dancing blade prevents two opponents from flanking the creature it fights for (though that creature can be flanked by additional opponents).

This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks).
If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.
Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet).
The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)&#8212;blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed.
The special powers of each version are as follows.
Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch.
You take only half damage from cold-based attacks.
If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch.

When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center.
When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center.
The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.
A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap.
An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.
Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast.
Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.
Note:Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a fire trap and Disable Device to thwart it.

Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe.
Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items.
However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe.
Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast.
The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area dispel magic.
You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.
Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.
For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a mirror image created by a caster outside the globe.
If that caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to reappear when the caster exited the globe.
Likewise, a caster standing in the area of a light spell would still receive sufficient illumination for vision, even though that part of the light spell's area that lies within the globe would not be luminous.
If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.

The assumed form can't have more Hit Dice than your caster level (or the subject's HD, whichever is lower), to a maximum of 15 HD at 15th level. You can't cause a subject to assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you cause a subject to assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. The subject's creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form (see the Monster Manual for more information).
Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal the subject further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains dead.
The subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict, improved grab, and poison) but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such as blindsense, fast healing, regeneration, and scent) or any supernatural or spell-like abilities.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action.

A wall of bones can be passed through as a full-round action, but its sharp spikes and edges deal 1d8 points of damage to any Small or Medium creature that attempts to do so.
Small creatures can slip and wriggle through the wall at will, but a Medium creature must make a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check.
Failure means that a creature takes damage as normal and becomes stuck in the wall.
It must make another move attempt the following round to either pass through the wall or pull back from it (taking damage from the movement either way).
Tiny or smaller creatures can slip freely through the wall at half speed, and Large or larger creatures cannot pass through it but might be able to break through (see below) or climb over, taking no damage.
Any creature trapped in the wall can choose to remain motionless until the spell expires to avoid taking any more damage.
The wall is 6 inches thick per caster level.
Each 5-foot square has 10 hit points per 6 inches of thickness, but the wall takes only half damage from slashing or piercing weapons.
A creature can make a Strength check (DC 15 + 2 per caster level, maximum + 10) to break through the wall with a single attack.
The wall is composed of bones of many different types of creatures, fused at bizarre angles, but it cannot be animated by an animate dead spell nor communicated with via speak with dead.

The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area.
In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it.
The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.
If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.
If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out.
(Do not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects).
Wall of fire can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent wall of fire that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures.
Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created.
Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed.
A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.
Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).
Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears.
The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level.
It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet).
The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored.
A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like.
Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.
Creatures can hit the wall automatically.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains.
Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).
Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level.
Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius.
The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach}}

The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2-2 in the **Dungeon Master's Guide**.  The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change.
The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.
<strong>Special: When casting **animal growth** as a Scalykind Domain spell, only ophidian and reptilian creatures are affected.</strong>
If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.  If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it&#8212;the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.
The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting}}

It can write in the languages it understands, but only the form is capable of writing in some manner (such as drawing in the dirt with a paw).</li></ul>With those exceptions, the target's normal game statistics are replaced by those of the new form. The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features.
All items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form.
If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.
If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save. If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form,  and its Hit Dice and hit points change to match an average creature of its new form. These abilities and  statistics return to normal if the effect is later ended.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the spell's effect)}}

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.
If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).
Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81).
Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.
You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it}}

The communication is one-way.
The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.

The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage.

The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.
Dispel evil cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the nightmare and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the dispel evil.

Spells cast on other creatures, objects, or locations (not on you) are vulnerable to **dispel magic** as normal.
The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent.

Your spirit is treated as an incorporeal creature for the purposes of determining movement, special qualities, and weaknesses, and has a speed of 90 feet but cannot move more than 200 feet from your body.
In your spirit form, a spellcaster using commune with lesser spirit or commune with greater spirit can contact you, and you can cast spells that have only verbal components.
You cannot attack physically or otherwise affect the physical world, and you can return your spirit to your body on your turn as a standard action.
While you function in your spirit form, your body assumes a half-awake state, able to take only one move action per round, losing its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any), and granting its foes a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it.
Within 5 feet of your body, you can command it to take simple actions such as walking, talking (in a slow, slurred fashion), or eating.
Damage taken by either your spirit or your body is subtracted from your hit point total, and if you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, you die.
Likewise, you die if your body moves more than 200 feet from your spirit form and you cannot follow (while under the effects of a spirit needle, for example), or if you are otherwise prevented from returning to your body when the spell ends.

You can prepare the spell to bear a message of up to twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver any other normal sounds for 1 round, or merely have a summoning wind seem to be a mysterious stirring of the air.
The wind travels to each recipient provided that it can find a way from you to their locations (the wind can travel around virtually any obstacle, but can't pass through closed portals or windows, regardless of whether they're airtight).
You choose its speed (from as slow as 1 mile per hour to as fast as 1 mile per 10 minutes), but the summoning wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the recipients, where it delivers its whisper-quiet message and dissipates.
As with magic mouth, a summoning wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects}}

The blade immediately attacks your enemy.**
You cause a blade of pale green force to appear and strike the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. Though it makes regular melee attacks, the sword strikes as a spell, not a weapon (and so can strike incorporeal creatures). A sword of deception always strikes from your direction, and so it can't be used to flank with your attacks, but it could flank with your allies.
The blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. In addition, each successful hit provides a -2 penalty on the target's next saving throw roll (-4 on a successful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of -5 on a single creature) and lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the benefit of a remove curse spell.
Each round, a sword of deception continues to attack the previous round's target unless you use a standard action to switch it to a new target within range. In any round when the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack as a standard action (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). The weapon can make multiple attack rolls against a single target with a full attack action if its base attack bonus permits. A sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as any other spell).
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check the first time the sword attacks. If the check is successful, the sword can attack that creature with normal effect for the duration of the spell. If not, the sword of deception is dispelled.

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.
**Sustained Force:** A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.
This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.
An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require  Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM.
**Combat Maneuver:** Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you  cease concentration.
**Violent Thrust:** Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object  or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).
You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).
Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves  (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points)}}

Interplanar travel is not possible.
You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.
You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels.
A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.
All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you.
Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.
You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination.
You can't simply teleport to the warlord's tent if you don't know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what's in it.
The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works.
Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.
To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table.
Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
Familiarity: &quot;Very familiar&quot; is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.
&quot;Studied carefully&quot; is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour.
&quot;Seen casually&quot; is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar.
&quot;Viewed once&quot; is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.
&quot;False destination&quot; is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on a enemy's sanctum but instead viewed a false vision, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground).
When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.
On Target: You appear where you want to be.
Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
Distance off target is 1d10&#215;1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled.
For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target.
That's 18 miles, in this case.
The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth.
If you were teleporting to a coastal city and would up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.
A wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory.
Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range.
If the DM determines no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.
Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten &quot;scrambled&quot;.
You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up.
For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.
Each time &quot;Mishap&quot; comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll}}

It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.
A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.
It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell's area by half.
Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch).
The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long.
In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates).
The spell has no effect on other creatures.
Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower.
Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates.
If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.
With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.

Acorn Grenades: As many as four acorns turn into special splash weapons that can be hurled as far as 100 feet.
A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target.
Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), divided up among the acorns as you wish.
For example, a 20th-level druid could create one 20d6 missile, two 10d6 missiles, one 11d6 and three 3d6 missiles, or any other combination totalling up to four acorns and 20d6 points of damage.
Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface.
In addition to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet.
A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.
Holly Berry Bombs: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs.
The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet).
If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet.

Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened.

Spells that affect wood (such as wood shape) do affect ironwood, although ironwood does not burn.
Using this spell with wood shape or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items.
Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts.
These items are freely usable by druids.
Further, if you make only half as much ironwood as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.

The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground.
Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved.

The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive.

Immediately, beings in the affected area cease moving, standing as still as statues.**
This spell causes any Medium or smaller humanoids within the area of the spell to become paralyzed. When casting the spell, you must specify a condition that will end it (&quot;Wait here until the dragon  arrives&quot;), even if that condition can never feasibly be met (&quot;Stay here until the sun shines at night&quot;). Subjects in the area that fail their saves immediately become aware of the condition, but they cannot communicate it due to their paralyzed state (although someone could use a spell such as detect thoughts to ascertain the condition). For every hour the creatures are transfixed before the condition is met, they are allowed another saving throw to break free of the spell's effect.
As long as the spell operates, any Medium or smaller humanoid that enters its area must make a successful saving throw or become transfixed with the same exit conditions (they too become aware of the exit conditions on becoming transfixed). Likewise, any creatures removed from the area are freed from the spell's effect. An affected creature that is attacked gains a new saving throw to break free of the enchantment.

True seeing does  not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it.
The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed.
Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly.
A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over.
Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves.
Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage.
The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.
Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

You sprout a pair of dull gleaming wings made of overlapping feathers of dark metal.
You grow a pair of adamantine wings.
The wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor or carry a medium or heavy load), with good maneuverability.
If you are not flying, you can use a standard action to make one wing attack or a full attack action to make two such attacks (as if they were natural weapons).
Each wing deals 2d6 points of slashing damage (plus your Strength modifier), and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
The wings are considered both magic and adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or penetrating hardness.
Wing strikes are not additional attacks; they replace any other attack or full attack action.
As a swift action, you can choose to launch the adamantine feathers as a burst of razor-sharp blades.
This attack takes the form of a 60-foot cone-shaped burst.
All creatures within the cone take 10d6 points of damage (Reflex half; spell resistance applies).
Since this is a spell effect, damage reduction does not affect the damage dealt by the cone.

This spell speeds the flow of magic through you, hastening your spellcasting ability. Casting times for arcane spells are reduced as follows:
Normal Casting Time     New Casting Time
1 standard action          1 swift action
1 full round                   1 standard action
2-10 rounds                  1 round less than normal
Arcane spellsurge has no effect on any spell with a casting time of greater than 1 minute or a casting time not listed on the table. You can't choose to ignore this effect; that is, you can't opt to cast a spell using its normal casting time. Thus, if all your spells normally have casting times of 1 standard action, they take 1 swift action instead, and because you can't take more than one swift action in a round, you won't be able to cast multiple spells per round while under the effect of arcane spellsurge. (If you have available spells with casting times of 1 full round, you are still able to cast more than one of those spells per round). However, a sorcerer or other spontaneous arcane caster could cast a metamagic spell (as a standard action) and a normal spell (as a swift action) in the same round.
This spell doesn't stack with any other effect that reduces a spell's casting time.
Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), you can cast this spell as a swift action}}

Creatures that have been dead no more than one day per caster level can be reanimated so long as their souls are free and willing to return (see Bringing Back the Dead, page 171 of the Player's Handbook).
The reanimated creature has 1 hit point and can take only a single move action each round (and so is unable to attack, use spells, or activate magic items).
Its speech (if it could speak while alive) is slow and slurred, and the creature's memory is cloudy, making it difficult for the subject to remember even the basic details of its past life.
If left unwatched, the creature is prone to wander off randomly.
It can gain temporary hit points but cannot increase its 1 hit point by means of a Constitution increase or any other method (though if it is wounded, healing can bring the creature back to 1 hit point again).
The creature can be killed again (and reanimated again if possible), and can be restored to full life by any spell that would restore a fully dead creature to life (such as raise dead).
As with gentle repose, time spent reanimated does not count against the time limit on raising the creature from the dead, and the reanimated body does not decay.
A reanimated creature is not undead, and it cannot be turned, harmed by positive energy or holy water, or healed by negative energy.

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect.  A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so.  This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points.

You can bring one Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear and objects up to its maximum load) per four caster levels.
A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.
A cloud chariot flies at 10 miles per minute, so that you can cover a distance of 100 miles over the spell's full duration.
You and your passengers feel none of the effects of this swift movement, though, and the ride is perfectly steady and calm in even the worst weather.
When the spell is dismissed, the cloud settles gently to the ground and dissipates.
Should the spell duration expire while a cloud chariot is still aloft, the magic fails slowly, with cloud and riders floating downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds.
If the cloud reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely.
If not, it falls the rest of the distance, and all creatures riding in it take falling damage.
A cloud chariot descends slowly if the spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.

The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more.
The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack.
A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.
The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below).
An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically.
An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff.
Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.
Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure).
At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.
Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on hit points for walls and the like).
Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground.
Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.
Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand.
At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.
Pinned beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.
If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead}}

All targets can make Reflex saves each round to take half damage.

This spell creates a field around you that deflects physical blows.
The field affects melee and ranged attacks made with natural or manufactured weapons, but not spells or magical attacks unless they are delivered with a physical touch attack.
Anyone who aims a melee or ranged attack against you must make a Will save to overcome the spell's effect.
If the save fails, all attacks that individual makes against you while the spell lasts have a 50% chance to be deflected to another target instead.
Spell resistance applies to this effect.
If a melee attack is deflected, the new target must be a creature both adjacent to you and within your attacker's melee reach.
If a ranged attack is deflected, the new target must be both adjacent to you and within your attacker's range.
If more than one target is available, determine which creature is attacked randomly.
Any combat modifiers (such as cover) apply to the attack.
A creature that has total cover against the attacker can't be selected as a target, nor can the attacker.
If no eligible target exists, the attack misses.
As an immediate action while the spell lasts, you can choose to redirect a deflected attack back at the attacker.

The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state.
The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines.
Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form.
If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.
Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature.
For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and then grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death.
If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed.
Perhaps you could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide.
In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM must adjudicate many of these situations.
A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell.
Magic items aren't affected by this spell.
This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine.
It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.
This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of baleful polymorph, polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute metal to wood, or transmute rock to mud.

At the time of casting, you must specify the condition against which you wish to protect yourself.
Should you be subjected to that condition during the duration of the spell, you feel no discomfort and take no damage from the condition, though the spell does not protect any items carried on your person.

When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150.
The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.
Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first.
Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.
A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.
Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).
To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.
Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.
As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.
Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).
Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.
In this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.
Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.
You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.
Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.
These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.
Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.
Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.
For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.
Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.
If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.
Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.
Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.
Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.
Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.
You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.
Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.
An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.
Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.
Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death}}

Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed.
Once the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level. For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take. For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chance
to be affected.
For example, you have three spell levels of absorption remaining and are struck by dominate person cast as a 5th-level spell. Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. If affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you're struck by disintegrate cast as a 6th-level spell with four levels of absorption remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (1/3) of the damage you would normally take from the spell.
You can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don't disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used). The levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell}}

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.
These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times.
If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation.
The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.
Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will.
To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord.
If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically.
Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).
When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely.
Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them.
The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you)}}

**Planar Travel:** As a mode of planar travel, a **gate** spell functions much like a <a href="/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/plane-shift--2423/">**plane shift**</a> spell, except that the **gate** opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a **gate** from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you&#8212;anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A **gate** cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
You could position a **gate** in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.
You may hold the **gate** open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.
**Calling Creatures:** The second effect of the **gate** spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the **gate** to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the **gate**, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a **gate** that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).
If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual&#8212;for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin&#8212;you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.
A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.
If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in &quot;livestock&quot; rather than in coin, which could involve complications). Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.
Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.
**Note:** When you use a calling spell such as **gate** to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, **gate** is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon}}

The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action.
For example, you are in combat and assume the form of a will-o'-wisp.
When this form is no longer useful, you change into a stone golem and walk away.
When pursued, you change into a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off.

If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way, such as by placing it on a raised platform.
Teleportation circle can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
Note:Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it.

You transform natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of red-hot molten lava. All creatures in the spell's area that make successful Reflex saves take 6d6 points of fire damage, provided they can physically escape the area on their next turn. Creatures that fail their saves, or those unable to escape the area, take 20d6 points of fire damage in each round they remain in the area. Creatures in the lava have their speed reduced to 5 feet and take a &#8212;2 penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class. Even after leaving the area of the spell, creatures that were exposed to the lava take half damage (either 3d6 or 10d6) for 1 additional round.
If transmute rock to lava is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the lava falls to the floor and spreads out in a 15-foot-radius pool at a depth of approximately 1-1/2 feet. The rain of lava deals 2d6 points of fire damage to anyone caught directly beneath (Reflex half). In addition, creatures take 10d6 points of fire damage each round when they are caught in the area of the pool.
Although constructions of worked stone can't be targeted with this spell, casting it on unworked stone below or adjacent to such structures deals 10d6 points of fire damage per round to any part of the structure in contact with the lava. Wooden structures in contact with lava instantly burst into flame.
The lava cools naturally from its surface toward its center, and it no longer deals fire damage after 2d6 hours as it slowly reverts to stone. Though a 15-foot-radius pool can take as long as two days to completely cool, the core of a 10-foot cube of lava might remain molten for a month or more.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even **wish**, however, has its limits.
A **wish** can produce any one of the following effects.
<ul><li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li><li>Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li><li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li><li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li><li>Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as **geas/quest** or **insanity**.</li><li>Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li><li>Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.</li><li>Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five **wish** spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li><li>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single **wish** can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same **wish**. A **wish** can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</li><li>Revive the dead. A **wish** can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A **wish** can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two **wish**, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A **wish** cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.</li><li>Transport travelers. A **wish** can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li><li>Undo misfortune. A **wish** can undo a single recent event. The **wish** forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a **wish** could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li></ul>You may try to use a **wish** to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a **wish** gives the DM the opportunity to fulfil your request without fulfilling it completely. (The **wish** may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment). For example, wishing for a **staff of the** magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff's current owner. Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisoned in a hidden extradimensional space (as by an imprisonment spell), where you could &quot;live&quot; indefinitely.
Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells)}}
