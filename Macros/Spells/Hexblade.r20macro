A &quot;weapon&quot; is generally defined as any manufactured weapon.
The spell detects improvised weapons such as bottles or pitchforks only if the wielder actively intends to use such an item as a weapon.
The amount of information revealed by this spell depends on how long you search a particular area.
1st Round: Presence or absence of weapons.

For example, suppose you have all three spells active when a foe strikes you. He first attempts to save  against karmic retribution. If that save fails, he is treated as if he had failed his saving throws against all three spells. If the first save succeeds, but the save against karmic backlash fails, he is treated as if  he had failed his saves against both that spell and karmic aura.

Treat a light weapon as an object two size categories smaller than its wielder, a one-handed weapon as one size category smaller than its wielder, and a two-handed weapon as an object of the same size as its wielder.
However, the weapon deals its normal damage, not the damage noted for an animated object of its size, and it gains a bonus on attack rolls equal to the ability modifier used to set your spell save DCs.
Diminutive or smaller objects are unaffected by the spell.
An animated weapon attacks the nearest enemy to the best of its ability.
You can use a move action to direct it to a different target, but if at the end of your turn you are more than 30 feet from the weapon, the spell ends.
A weapon held or carried by another creature can't be affected by this spell.
The weapon doesn't gain the benefit of any of your class features, feats, or other special abilities that would improve its combat ability.

It attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + the modifier for your spell save DCs.
Each hit deals 1 point of Strength damage to the target.
The first time a target is hit, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect; this negates the damage and renders it immune to further attacks by the shadow double.
The shadow double occupies a space identical to yours.
It is not incorporeal, and thus can't share a space with another creature or object.
It can provide a flanking bonus against any creature that hasn't yet saved successfully against it.
The shadow double can strike incorporeal creatures, but not ethereal creatures.
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to direct the shadow double to attack any other target.
To attack this new target, the shadow double can move to any new legal space within 30 feet (it moves by instantaneous teleportation).
If it is not commanded to switch targets, it continues to attack the same target.
A shadow double can be attacked.
It has an Armor Class equal to 10 + your size modifier + a deflection bonus equal to the modifier for your spell save DCs, and has one-fifth of your full normal hit points.

This is identical to the effect of a dispel magic spell targeted on an object, except for duration and your ability to invest essentia to improve your caster level check.

Closing his eyes negates this effect but also effectively blinds him.

Unlike normal poison, this attack has no secondary damage, though you can continue to &quot;bite&quot; the subject each round.

You can command a hound of doom as a move action just as if it were fully trained to perform all the tricks listed in the Handle Animal skill (see page 74 of the Player's Handbook).

You attempt to steal an opponent's beneficial spell effects for yourself.
Upon casting this spell, you instantly discern all spells currently affecting the target (including their effects).
For each spell so discerned, you can make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level.
If the check succeeds, you gain the effect of the spell for the remainder of its duration, as if it had been cast on you instead of the original target, and the opponent loses that effect.
Only spells capable of being dispelled can be affected by spell theft.
In addition, if you are not a legal target of the spell to be stolen, your dispel check automatically fails.
For example, if you cast spell theft on a dire bear affected by bull's strength and animal growth, you could steal only the effect of the first spell unless you were also of the animal type}}
