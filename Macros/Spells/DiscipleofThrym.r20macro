Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.
Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell (Magic item's saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled.
It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.
The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.
The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration.
During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage.
In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.
Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.
For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage.
Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.
Chill metal counters and dispels heat metal}}

Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears.
The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level.
It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet).
The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored.
A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like.
Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.
Creatures can hit the wall automatically.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains.
Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).
Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level.
Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius.
The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach}}
