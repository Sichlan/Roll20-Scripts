In the trance, you are highly attuned to the powers and forces in the immediate area.
You can sense certain magical creatures and effects within the spell's area.
Each round you remain in the trance, you feel the presence of any one lesser spirit, greater spirit, curse, permanent magical effect, or haunting within the spell's area.
You can determine the general type of thing contacted (such as natural spirit, evil haunting), but cannot communicate with it in any way or gain any other information about it.
Using this spell does give you enough information to subsequently cast commune with lesser spirit or a similar spell to communicate with the spirit you desire to contact}}


Commune With Lesser Spirit(Complete Arcane): - Nature(2)

You must know the identity of the spirit, and you must be within 10 feet of the spirit's location.
The spirit's knowledge is limited to matters within its immediate area (so that the spirit of a great tree in a village cannot answer questions about events outside the village, for example), and you must ask questions that could typically have one-word answers.
&quot;Unclear&quot; is a legitimate answer, because spirits are not necessarily omniscient, but in cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the spirit's interests, the DM can respond with a short phrase (five words or less) instead.
If the spirit has been subject to commune with lesser spirit (or commune with greater spirit) within the past week, this spell fails.
As well, if the spirit's alignment is different from yours, it gets a Will save to resist the spell.
Unasked questions are wasted if the spell's duration expires.
Material Component: Incense and a small offering worth 10 gp}}

The target must be a normal animal (not a magical beast, vermin, or other monster type), and your caster level must exceed its Hit Dice.
The animal's soul remains in its body but has no control over it while your spirit is there.
Your own body lies comatose for the duration of the spell.
While in the animal's body, you keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, classes, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.
You can cast spells while you possess the animal only if you have the Natural Spell feat or an equivalent ability, and you can't activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities.
Furthermore, for every 2 points of damage taken by the animal body while you are possessing it, you take 1 point of damage.
If the animal body is killed while you are possessing it, you must make a DC 10 Fortitude save or die as well.
If your body is destroyed while your spirit is in the animal's body, you die at the end of the spell's duration.
Material Component: A bowl of incense and a morsel of food appealing to the target animal}}
