Against a living creature, this attack deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
Against undead, handfire deals 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).

Obediently, the plants surrounding you oblige.**
Anyone in the area of the spell (including you) finds the undergrowth held aside while they pass. This effect essentially provides a trail through any kind of undergrowth, and you treat any trackless terrain as having a trail (**PH** 164). Once the effect of the spell passes, the plants return to their normal shape. The DC to track anyone who traveled within the area of this spell increases by 5 (the equivalent of hiding the trail).
This spell has no effect on plant creatures (that is, they aren't pushed or held aside by its effect)}}

You cause a mask of shadows to form around your face. It does not impede your vision, cannot be physically removed, completely hides your features, and protects you against certain attacks. You receive a +4 bonus on saving throws against light or darkness spells and any spells that rely on bright light for damaging effects, such as the flare spell or the fireworks effect of pyrotechnics. You also gain a 50% chance each round to avoid having to make a saving throw against gaze attacks, just as if you averted your eyes. If you avert your eyes while using shadow mask, you get to check twice to see if you avoid having to make the saving throw.
When the spell's duration ends, the shadow mask fades over the course of 1d4 rounds (rather than immediately), giving you time to keep your face hidden by other means. A successful dispel magic cast  against a shadow mask effectively ends the spell and causes the same slow fading.
Material Component: A mask of black cloth}}

You perceive tracks as if they had just been made. You must notice the prints normally with a successful Search or Survival check, but this eliminates any penalties to your tracking due to the passage of time or any rainfall since the making of the trail. This spell has no effect on tracks more than thirty days old}}
